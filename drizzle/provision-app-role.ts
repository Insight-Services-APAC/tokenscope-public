/*
 * drizzle/provision-app-role.ts — mint the NON-OWNER database role that makes
 * the RLS policies execute.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS FOR (docs/design/rls-enforcement.md §9). TokenScope has 40 RLS
 * policies across 23 tables and none of them run: the app connects as the role
 * that OWNS the tables, and an owner bypasses RLS unless the table sets `FORCE
 * ROW LEVEL SECURITY`. Enforcement needs a non-owner. The design doc's runbook
 * called that step "out-of-band work by a database administrator" — but there is
 * no DBA here, and there does not need to be one: this script runs at boot from
 * `entrypoint.sh`, on the same `DATABASE_URL` the migration runner already uses
 * (the Flexible Server `administratorLogin`, inside the VNet), which can reach
 * `CREATEROLE` — directly or through `SET ROLE azure_pg_admin` (see
 * {@link resolveProvisionBasis}).
 *
 * ── IT CREATES A ROLE. IT DOES NOT TOUCH RLS POSTURE. ───────────────────────
 * The cutover DISABLE sweep used to live here, and its TRIGGER was wrong three
 * adversarial rounds running — on every boot (which undid design §7 phase 2 at
 * the next restart), only when this boot created the role (which could never
 * fire on an environment past its first boot), then on a version ledger alone
 * (which let a bump or a restored database revert a phase and stamp the result
 * as done). Every answer to "when should PROVISIONING sweep?" was wrong because
 * the question was: provisioning creates a role, and cutting an estate over to
 * RLS enforcement is a separate, deliberate, once-per-environment act.
 *
 * It is now `drizzle/cutover-rls-sweep.ts`, behind its own opt-in
 * (`TOKENSCOPE_RLS_CUTOVER_SWEEP`), and its rule is that a table which is
 * ENABLEd **and** FORCEd is never disabled. THIS file still READS the RLS
 * posture and reports it — a role handed out while unvetted tables would bind it
 * is worth a line in the boot log — but it never mutates it, on any code path.
 *
 * ── WHAT A BOOT DOES, IN EACH STATE ─────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *   no opt-in, no runtime URL → one log line, exit 0. Nothing read or written.
 *   no opt-in, runtime URL    → probes THAT credential only (see below), and
 *                               aborts if it is genuinely broken. Nothing is
 *                               written.
 *   opted in, role ABSENT     → CREATE ROLE, set its password, grants,
 *                               ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES. One transaction.
 *   opted in, role PRESENT    → converge its attributes, grants,
 *                               ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES — and the password is
 *                               NOT TOUCHED. Same transaction.
 *
 * ── WHY THE DORMANT PATH STILL CHECKS THE RUNTIME CREDENTIAL ────────────────
 * `useAppRoleAtRuntime=true` with `provisionAppRole=false` is a combination
 * Bicep permits, and it used to be silent: this step logged "dormant", exited 0,
 * Nitro started on a credential the database rejects, and `/api/health` answered
 * 503 with none of the targeted recovery guidance below. The hazard is not "the
 * provisioning flag is off" — it is "the runtime is pointed at a credential that
 * does not work", which is a property of `TOKENSCOPE_APP_DATABASE_URL` ALONE.
 * Coupling the two flags in Bicep would not have covered it either: the role can
 * be dropped, or the secret can drift, with provisioning firmly on. So the check
 * belongs to the credential, not to the flag.
 *
 * TRUE dormancy is preserved where it matters: with no opt-in AND no
 * `TOKENSCOPE_APP_DATABASE_URL` — every environment today — nothing is read and
 * nothing is written, which is what makes this safe to merge and deploy.
 *
 * ── THE PASSWORD IS SET ONCE, WHEN THE ROLE IS CREATED ──────────────────────
 * A boot that finds the role already there must never move its password. Almost
 * every hazard this file used to carry came from rotating on every boot: a
 * rolling revision where an old-secret and a new-secret replica both boot, the
 * database-clock guard that made the loss loud rather than ordered, a login
 * probe whose only job was to skip the rotation, and an exit code for "we moved
 * the password and could not prove the result". None of it is here now, because
 * ROTATING ON EVERY BOOT is not here.
 *
 * ROTATION IS STILL POSSIBLE, AND IT IS EXPLICIT.
 * `TOKENSCOPE_ROTATE_APP_DB_PASSWORD=true` sets an EXISTING role's password to
 * `TOKENSCOPE_APP_DB_PASSWORD`. That flag is THE ONLY PATH IN THIS FILE THAT
 * CHANGES AN EXISTING ROLE'S PASSWORD. It is off by default and is meant to be
 * on for one boot, deliberately — never left on, or a restart becomes a rotation
 * again. `infra/parameters/dev.bicepparam` documents the dispatch. A boot WITH
 * that flag set does rotate, so "no boot moves a password" is false and no
 * comment here may say it.
 *
 * DORMANCY IS THE ABSENCE OF AN OPT-IN, NOT A MISSING PASSWORD. An operator who
 * set the flag has asked for a role; if `TOKENSCOPE_APP_DB_PASSWORD` is missing
 * or empty that is a broken deployment, and this exits NON-ZERO naming it. It
 * used to log "dormant" and exit 0, which meant the app booted with no role
 * while the operator believed they had enabled one.
 *
 * ── WHY IT VERIFIES ITSELF ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A provisioning step that reports success without reading its own result is how
 * this project has been burned repeatedly. So before it says "done" it reads
 * back: the role exists, it can log in, it is NOT a superuser, NOT `BYPASSRLS`,
 * NOT `INHERIT`, cannot reach a table owner by any grant shape that Postgres
 * actually honours, and a real connection AS the role succeeds. The login probe
 * prefers `TOKENSCOPE_APP_DATABASE_URL` when it is set, so what is proven is the
 * exact string the runtime pools will use.
 *
 * THE RLS-POSTURE LINE IS A REPORT, NEVER AN ASSERTION. This step does not own
 * that state — the cutover sweep and then the rollout's phases do — so it says
 * what it sees and exits 0. Asserting it would turn design §7 phase 2, which
 * deliberately re-`ENABLE`s `org_unit`, `teammate` and `instance_attestation`,
 * into an un-bootable image that nobody here has the database access to repair.
 *
 * ── THE OWNER URL STAYS THE OWNER URL ───────────────────────────────────────
 * This script and `migrate.ts` both connect with `DATABASE_URL`. Migrations must
 * OWN their objects, and `ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES` here (unqualified, i.e. FOR
 * ROLE current_user) only covers objects created by the role running it — which
 * is exactly why both must stay on the same login. Point migrations at the app
 * role and future tables silently stop being reachable.
 *
 *   TOKENSCOPE_PROVISION_APP_ROLE=true TOKENSCOPE_APP_DB_PASSWORD=… \
 *   DATABASE_URL=… tsx drizzle/provision-app-role.ts    # npm run db:provision-app-role
 *
 * ── EXIT CODES (entrypoint.sh reads them) ───────────────────────────────────
 *   0  dormant, or provisioned and verified.
 *   1  the step did not finish. Boot continues; the next boot retries. A failed
 *      run cannot have taken the runtime's credential away: an existing role's
 *      password is untouched unless rotation was explicitly requested, and a
 *      rotation is one statement inside the one transaction, so a failure either
 *      side of the commit leaves a credential that some deployment holds.
 *   3  the runtime is configured, through `TOKENSCOPE_APP_DATABASE_URL`, to
 *      connect as a role whose credential is genuinely broken — unparseable,
 *      rejected by the server's AUTHENTICATION (SQLSTATE class 28), pointed at a
 *      database that does not exist (3D000), or authenticating as somebody else.
 *      Booting would serve 500s from a healthy-looking deploy.
 *      A database this process could not REACH is NOT this — the server never
 *      answered, so there is no evidence about the credential — and neither is a
 *      server error that is not about identity (`53300 too many connections`,
 *      say). Both exit 1 and boot continues: if the fault persists the revision
 *      fails its readiness probe and Container Apps keeps the previous one, and
 *      if it was a blip the app serves. Aborting would buy neither.
 *
 * ANY OTHER non-zero code is a signal death (an OOM kill or a boot timeout exits
 * 128+N) and `entrypoint.sh` treats it as unsafe whenever provisioning was
 * requested. {@link PROVISION_BUDGET_MS} exists so the ordinary slow paths
 * cannot get there: losing that race rejects into the SAME exit path as any
 * other failure, so the run really does classify itself first.
 *
 * NEVER LOGS THE PASSWORD, and never sends it either — see
 * {@link scramSha256Verifier}. The one statement carrying the derived verifier
 * has its error message suppressed to a pg SQLSTATE, because a server error can
 * quote the statement text back at you.

 *
 * `infra/modules/container-app.bicep` gives the container a Startup probe of

 * 225s window from container start to the platform giving up and killing it.
 * `entrypoint.sh` spends that window serially: pre-flight, migrations, THIS
 * STEP, the cutover sweep, the binding gate, two seeds, then Nitro binds.
 *
 * THIS DEADLINE DOES NOT ESTABLISH A 225s CONTAINER-START GUARANTEE, and an
 * earlier version of this comment claimed it did. It cannot, because the steps
 * in front of it are not all bounded:
 *
 *   scripts/preflight-run.ts   BOUNDED — 30s (preflight.ts CRITICAL_TIMEOUT_MS),
 *                              probes run concurrently — PLUS the RLS posture
 *                              line it logs afterwards, its own connect +
 *                              statement bound. The step is not just
 *                              `preflight.ts`, and counting it as though it
 *                              were is one of the ways this total has been
 *                              wrong.
 *   drizzle/migrate.ts         **UNBOUNDED**, deliberately. Its connect is
 *                              bounded by postgres.js's 30s default, but the
 *                              migrations themselves carry no
 *                              `statement_timeout` and must not: interrupting a
 *                              schema change part-way is worse than overrunning
 *                              a probe, and a long migration overrunning the
 *                              window is the accepted behaviour today.
 *   this step                  BOUNDED — PROVISION_BUDGET_MS, + up to
 *                              CONNECT_TIMEOUT_S + PROBE_STATEMENT_TIMEOUT for
 *                              the exit-3 classifier's own probe, which runs
 *                              after the deadline clears and is therefore
 *                              outside it. Both terms are needed: connecting
 *                              and querying are separately unbounded, and the
 *                              statement term was missing while this line
 *                              claimed the total.
 *   cutover-rls-sweep.ts       BOUNDED — its own equivalent deadline.
 *   assert-runtime-rls-safe.ts BOUNDED — GATE_BUDGET_MS, covering three serial
 *                              round trips including a second connection.
 *                              Dormant, and therefore free, unless the runtime
 *                              is bound to the app role.
 *   the two seeds              unbounded, and small.
 *
 * So what the deadline buys is narrower and worth stating exactly: A STEP THAT
 * CANNOT FINISH EXITS WITH A CODE `entrypoint.sh` UNDERSTANDS instead of being
 * SIGKILLed at 128+N, which the contract does not define. Per-statement timeouts
 * could not do that on their own — several of the waits here are not statements
 * (a pool open, a connection reserve) — which is why there is a wall-clock
 * deadline at all.
 *
 * The per-step bounds exist so the COMMON failures classify well inside it
 * rather than hitting the deadline:
 *
 *   database unreachable        →  10s   (connect timeout)   → exit 1
 *   a peer holds the lock       →  25s   (connect + lock)    → exit 1
 *   the tx queues on a lock     →  30s   (+ tx lock_timeout) → exit 1, rolled back
 *   happy path                  →  ~2s
 *
 * 30s, not 45s, and the reason is arithmetic rather than taste: the BOUNDED
 * steps must not be able to consume the window on their own. At 45s each they
 * summed past the window and the container could be killed with every step
 * behaving exactly as designed.
 *
 * THE SUM IS NO LONGER WRITTEN OUT HERE, deliberately. Every hand-maintained
 * version of it has been wrong: it omitted the binding gate, then omitted
 * client teardown while asserting a headroom it did not have, then counted the
 * gate's two parallel closes as serial, and this header went on quoting a 125s
 * window for two rounds after Bicep stopped saying 125s.
 * `tests/unit/scripts/provision-app-role-contract.test.ts` derives EVERY term
 * from its own source — the Bicep probe, each script's constants, the posture
 * probe and the teardowns — and requires 60s of headroom for Nitro's own
 * launch. Read the numbers there, where they cannot go stale.
 *
 * Overridable so a test can prove the deadline actually FIRES mid-run rather
 * than asserting arithmetic about it — the same shape as `PREFLIGHT_TIMEOUT_MS`
 * in `scripts/preflight.ts`.

/**
 * Refuse to certify a role that can REACH a TABLE OWNER — by any grant shape
 * Postgres actually honours, and by NO shape it does not.
 *
 * Postgres decides the RLS owner bypass with `has_privs_of_role()`, so a role
 * that holds the owner's privileges reads the estate with every policy inert.
 * Pointing the app at that would look exactly like a completed cutover.
 *
 * ── MEASURED ON PostgreSQL 16.13: ALL 21 SHAPES, END TO END ─────────────────
 * PG 16 made INHERIT, SET and ADMIN properties of each GRANT and they are
 * INDEPENDENT. Each cell below was executed against a real RLS-enabled table
 * owned by another role: the app role tried to read it as itself, after
 * `SET ROLE`, and after re-granting itself `SET` where it held ADMIN OPTION.
 * `I` = INHERIT only, `S` = SET only, `A` = ADMIN only, `N` = none of the three.
 *
 *   direct grant of the owner to the app role
 *     I  BYPASS (reads it directly)   S  BYPASS (SET ROLE, then reads it)
 *     A  BYPASS (re-grants itself SET, then the above)          N  no
 *
 *   two hops, app -h1-> mid -h2-> owner        h2:  I       S       A       N
 *                                          h1: I  BYPASS  no      BYPASS  no
 *                                              S  BYPASS  BYPASS  BYPASS  no
 *                                              A  BYPASS  BYPASS  BYPASS  no
 *                                              N  no      no      no      no
 *
 * Two facts fall out, and the predicate below is exactly them:
 *
 *   1. AN `N` EDGE REACHES NOTHING, and is not itself a bypass. The previous
 *      walk followed every `pg_auth_members` row regardless of its options, so
 *      it called 9 of those 21 shapes a bypass and refused to provision. That is
 *      this check's THIRD wrong answer in three directions (under-rejecting,
 *      corrected, over-corrected), which is why it is now measured rather than
 *      reasoned about.
 *   2. `I -> S` DOES NOT COMPOSE. Inheriting a role's privileges does not lend
 *      you its ability to `SET ROLE`. Everything else composes, because ADMIN
 *      OPTION *is* an inheritable privilege — an `I -> A` member simply grants
 *      itself `SET` and proceeds.
 *
 * So the walk carries one bit per reached role: can we BECOME it (`SET`, or
 * `ADMIN` which buys `SET`), or do we merely hold its privileges? An edge is
 * followed when it INHERITs, when it grants ADMIN, or when it grants SET and we
 * can become the role holding it.
 *
 * It also carries which OPTIONS the followed edges used, and that is what the
 * refusal message names. A single grant routinely carries more than one (PG 16's
 * default is INHERIT-from-`rolinherit` plus `SET TRUE`), and a chain can use a
 * different one at each hop, so picking "the" route to report is a guess — this
 * message got it wrong once already by naming INHERIT for a grant whose real
 * route was `SET ROLE`.
 *
 * ONE CAVEAT WORTH KNOWING BEFORE YOU TRY TO REPRODUCE THE `ADMIN` ROW: it does
 * not fire when the owner is a SUPERUSER, because `GRANT` then refuses with
 * *"Only roles with the SUPERUSER attribute may grant roles with the SUPERUSER
 * attribute"* (measured). That is a property of the fixture, not of the
 * predicate — on Azure the table owner is `administratorLogin`, which is not a
 * superuser, and the escalation is available. A test that uses the default
 * testcontainers superuser as the owner will quietly show no bypass.
 *
 * ── AND WHY IT IS A CATALOG WALK RATHER THAN `pg_has_role` ──────────────────
 * `pg_has_role(app, owner, 'USAGE' | 'SET')` — what the two arms here used to be
 * — is wrong in BOTH directions on that table. It is VACUOUSLY TRUE for a
 * superuser, so a pre-existing SUPERUSER `tokenscope_app` skipped the check
 * entirely and was caught only after the commit. And it is FALSE for six real
 * bypasses: every `A` shape, and `S -> I`, where the app `SET ROLE`s to a
 * middle role that inherits the owner (measured: `USAGE` f, `SET` f, and the
 * owner's row read anyway). The walk answers both independently of `rolsuper`.
 *
 * The app role OWNING a table is its own arm, spelled out rather than left to
 * `pg_has_role`'s reflexivity: it is the plainest bypass there is.
 *
 * ── WHY IT REFUSES INSTEAD OF FIXING ────────────────────────────────────────
 * `ALTER ROLE app NOINHERIT` does NOT clear an inheriting membership: PG 16
 * fixes each grant's INHERIT from the member's `rolinherit` AT GRANT TIME and
 * `ALTER ROLE` never revisits it (measured: `rolinherit` goes false while
 * `inherit_option` and `USAGE` stay true). Only `REVOKE` undoes a grant somebody
 * made deliberately, so this names it and stops.

   * A previous version of this file ran

   * here, reading migration 0118's header as a shopping list:
   *
   *   "WHAT ACTUALLY LANDS IT: the non-owner writer role … When that role
   *    exists, this becomes two lines (`GRANT SELECT …; REVOKE INSERT, UPDATE,
   *    DELETE … FROM <role>`) plus the permission test the invariant asks for."
   *
   * 0118 proposes revoking from a JOINER role — a role SEPARATE from the writer.
   * THERE IS EXACTLY ONE RUNTIME ROLE. `server/db/worker-db.ts::getWorkerDb()`
   * resolves the same `TOKENSCOPE_APP_DATABASE_URL` as the request lane, so the
   * provider-transform worker authenticates as `tokenscope_app` — and it is the
   * writer: `server/workers/provider-fact.ts:189` INSERTs into
   * `provider_usage_fact` and `server/workers/provider-transform.ts:616` DELETEs
   * from it. Revoking those from the only role that exists does not enforce the
   * invariant, it BREAKS THE API LANE: after cutover both statements fail and
   * the model axis stops being written.
   *
   * WITH A SINGLE APP ROLE THE INVARIANT IS NOT EXPRESSIBLE AS A GRANT. Grants
   * are per (role, table); the distinction 0118 wants is per CALL SITE inside
   * one role. Landing it needs one of:
   *   - a SECOND login role for the joiner lane, with its own pool and its own
   *     URL, so "the joiner cannot write this table" becomes a real grant; or
   *   - an RLS WRITE policy on `provider_usage_fact` keyed on a lane GUC (the
   *     worker lane already carries `app.user_role=global-finops`), so the
   *     write is refused by predicate rather than by privilege.
   * Either is its own change with its own blast radius. Until one lands the
   * property is held by code review, exactly as 0118 says it is.
   *
   * `tests/integration/db/provision-app-role.test.ts` asserts the app role CAN
   * INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE `provider_usage_fact`, so re-adding the revoke
   * turns a test red instead of turning the API lane off in production.
