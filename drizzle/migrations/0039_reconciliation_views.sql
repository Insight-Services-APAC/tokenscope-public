-- 0039: reconciliation engine — effective-spend + finance-reportable views.
--
-- See docs/design/reconciliation-engine.md §3.3 / §7.5.
--
-- v_effective_spend       = immutable OTel truth (attribution_record) UNION applied
--                           reconciliation deltas. The SINGLE money surface.
-- v_finance_reportable_spend = v_effective_spend minus indicative (the cross-charge
--                           gate: only billed/estimated may feed PSR).
--
-- spend_class is DERIVED here from attribution_record.cost_basis (rate-card /
-- estimated -> estimated [reconcilable]; telemetry-only -> indicative). cost_basis
-- itself is UNTOUCHED — spend_class is the money-vs-signal axis "alongside" it
-- (§3.1). reconciliation_record carries its own spend_class column.
--
-- security_invoker = true (PG15+): the views run with the QUERYING role's RLS on
-- the underlying tables, so swapping a rollup from `attribution_record` to the view
-- preserves row-level security (it does not become a definer-privilege bypass).
--
-- Both views expose the emitter region_id (NOT NULL on the attribution side) so
-- finance-scope's region clamp keeps working after the rewire (R3 M-2).
