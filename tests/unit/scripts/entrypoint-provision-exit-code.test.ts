/*
 * entrypoint.sh READS THE PROVISIONING EXIT CODE, and the codes mean different
 * things.
 *
 * `drizzle/provision-app-role.ts` runs its whole change in one transaction, so:
 *   1 = the step did not finish. Boot carries on and the next boot retries. A
 *       failed run cannot have broken the runtime's credential: the step sets a
 *       password only when it CREATEs the role, or when rotation was explicitly
 *       requested. A database it could not REACH lands here too — no credential
 *       change fixes DNS or a server that is down.
 *   3 = `TOKENSCOPE_APP_DATABASE_URL` names a credential that is genuinely
 *       broken: unparseable, refused by the server, or authenticating as someone
 *       else. Booting would serve 500s while the deploy read healthy.
 *   * = ANY OTHER non-zero code is undefined by that contract. A SIGKILL — the
 *       OOM killer, a boot timeout — exits 128+N, and it can land after the
 *       transaction committed and before anything reported it. The old shell
 *       took the `-ne 0` branch, logged "rolled back… non-fatal", and booted on a
 *       credential it had never verified.
 *
 * EXIT 2 IS GONE, and its absence is asserted below rather than merely omitted.
 * It meant "the run COMMITTED and could not verify", and it existed because
 * EVERY boot rotated, so any commit might have moved the password out from under
 * a live replica. Rotation is now opt-in and off by default — a boot with
 * `TOKENSCOPE_ROTATE_APP_DB_PASSWORD=true` still rotates, so "no boot rotates"
 * would be false — but that was never the right question anyway: whether BOOT IS
 * SAFE is answered by probing the runtime's own credential, which is exit 3, and
 * it is answered identically whether the run rotated, created or did nothing.
 * So a 2 from an image is a code this shell does not define, and it lands in the
 * `*` branch, which is the conservative answer for a state nobody can describe.
 *
 * THE CUTOVER SWEEP IS A SECOND STEP with a fourth code of its own (4 = refused
 * on a §5-vs-§7 conflict), asserted in its own describe below.
 *
 * Nothing else in the suite can see this: the provisioning tests assert the exit
 * codes the SCRIPT produces, and the shell that acts on them is not TypeScript.
 * So this runs the real `entrypoint.sh` with a stub `node` on PATH that returns
 * a chosen code — or genuinely dies by signal — for the step under test and 0
 * for every other step, and reads what the shell did with it.
