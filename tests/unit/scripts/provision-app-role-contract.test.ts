/*
 * THREE CLASSES THAT NO OTHER GATE IN THIS REPO CAN SEE, all of which shipped on
 * this branch once already.
 *
 * 1. POST-COMMIT CODE THAT SITS OUTSIDE THE POST-COMMIT GUARD.
 *    `reportProvisioning(report)` used to run between `sql.begin()` returning and
 *    the `try` that reports the run as committed. A throw there — formatting a
 *    report about a database that had already been changed — came out claiming
 *    "the transaction was rolled back". There is no runtime way to make a
 *    `console.warn` throw in a child process, so the ordering is asserted against
 *    the SOURCE. That is a weaker instrument than a behavioural test and it is
 *    the right one here: the defect is positional, and position is exactly what a
 *    source assertion can see.
 *
 * 2. PROSE THAT DESCRIBES BEHAVIOUR THE CODE NO LONGER HAS.
 *    Three Bicep files tell the operator what `provisionAppRole` does, and they
 *    have been wrong twice: once when they said the sweep was bootstrap-only, and
 *    again when they said the flag "re-syncs the role if the password is ever
 *    rotated" — which was true when every boot rotated and became false the day
 *    that stopped. Nothing recompiles a comment (CLAUDE.md rule 17).
 *
 * 3. A STARTUP BUDGET THAT NO LONGER FITS THE PROBE.
 *    The step runs inside the container's Startup probe window. Nothing type-
 *    checks a timeout against a Bicep probe, so the two drift silently and the
 *    symptom is a SIGKILL — an exit code the entrypoint contract does not define.
