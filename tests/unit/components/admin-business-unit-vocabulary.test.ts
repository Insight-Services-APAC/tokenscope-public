/*
 * THE REPORTED UNIT IS A BUSINESS UNIT. "COST CENTRE" IS A DIFFERENT THING.
 *
 * A cost centre here is an OPTIONAL finance code that can be tagged onto a
 * Business Unit — the `costCenter` attribute the directory carries, unused by
 * this product today. Calling the Business Unit itself a "cost centre" collides
 * two objects an admin can see side by side on one screen, and it kept coming
 * back after being ruled out: the reporting layer was swept while the admin
 * screens, which are where the org structure is actually configured, kept the
 * old word in every heading, button and toast.
 *
 * ── WHY A SOURCE SCAN AND NOT A RENDER ASSERTION ─────────────────────────────
 * A render check proves one dialog says the right word today. The failure mode
 * is additive — the next admin surface someone writes — so the assertion has to
 * be over the whole directory. That is the difference between the rule holding
 * and the rule being written down again.
 *
 * ── WHAT IS DELIBERATELY ALLOWED ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Everything that is not prose:
 *   - identifiers and wire keys: `cost_owning_unit_id`, `costCentre`, `couId`,
 *     `cou_owner`. Renaming a label and renaming a contract are different
 *     changes; only the first one happened.
 *   - `data-testid`s, the `?tab=cost-centres` slug, the `/cost-centres` route
 *     and the `cost-centre-owner` help anchor — all addresses, and a saved link
 *     or a green test is not worth a word.
 *   - `costCenter` / "directory cost-centre code": the REAL finance code, the
 *     one thing this rename must not swallow.
 *   - "cost-owning unit": a genuine property (a unit that carries P&L, versus a
 *     container that groups others), not a synonym for the unit itself.
