/*
 * F5 — the cost-centre owner's page, as it RENDERS.
 *
 * The outcome under test: an owner lands on THEIR centre and sees, without
 * clicking anything, what they are accountable for, what the money went to, and
 * who spent it. Most of this was built and then put behind a door with no
 * handle — `CcDrill` mounted only inside a `v-else-if` reachable by clicking a
 * name in a budget table — so these assertions are as much about REACHABILITY
 * as about content.
 *
 * T23 the page lands scoped, names the centre, and the selector is absent when
 *     there is one option.
 * T24 both tables, no pivot chips, no truncation — a 14-person centre lists 14.
 * T25 the project row carries both operands.
 * T30 the Projects table: share, this month, against-budget including over-100%
 *     and "no budget", the "Not on a project" row, and a tier breakdown whose
 *     unmatched models land in `unclassified`.
