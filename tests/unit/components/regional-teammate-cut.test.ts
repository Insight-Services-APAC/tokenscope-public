/*
 * THE REGIONAL CONTAINER ASKS EACH QUESTION ONCE — AND RENDERS THE ANSWER IT ASKED FOR.
 *
 * `docs/design/reporting-stakeholder-visibility/00-decisions.md` §5b Five: "the
 * reporting surfaces discard roughly half their requests … Fix by deleting work,
 * not optimising it."
 *
 * Two deletions are pinned here.
 *
 * 1. The default region is the SERVER's answer. ScopeRegional used to wait for
 *    the first response, fetch the whole-company region ranking to find the
 *    biggest region, and patch the URL — which recomputed every query object and
 *    re-issued all seven fetches, so the entire first round was thrown away and
 *    the user watched one region's figures flip to another's. The rule now lives
 *    in resolveRegionalScope (tests/integration/reports/regional-default-region).
 *
 * 2. The switchable DriversTable and the Concentration card request the SAME URL
 *    whenever the table's axis is 'teammate' — under two different `useFetch`
 *    keys, and Nuxt shares in-flight promises per KEY, so it was two round-trips
 *    for one answer. teammate-cut.ts decides which request serves the table.
 *
 * Deletion (2) creates a hazard that is worse than the duplicate it removes: a
 * request that never runs leaves its `data`/`pending`/`error` refs holding the
 * PREVIOUS axis's state forever. So the container must read the request that is
 * actually serving the table on all three of those, and the table must render a
 * payload only when the payload itself says it is the axis AND the region on
 * screen. The concentration card and the top-models bar read their own axis-fixed
 * requests directly, so they are held to the same test — otherwise they would show
 * the previous region's rows beside a table that had correctly gone blank. The trend
 * request feeds four more cards and carries a region but no axis, so it takes the
 * REGION half of that test. `active-trend` and `seasonality` carry no region at all
 * and are NOT covered — see the last describe.
 *
 * The container is MOUNTED here, not read as source. `useFetch`/`useRoute`/
 * `useRouter`/`$fetch` are Nuxt auto-imports, so they are stubbed as globals and
 * ScopeRegionalView is mocked; every assertion below is on what the container
 * requested and what it handed the view. A source-substring check would pass with
 * any of these behaviours inverted, which is precisely how the gap it was meant to
 * cover got shipped.
