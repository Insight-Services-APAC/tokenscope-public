/*
 * r3-M6 — FINANCE'S DRILL LINKS CARRY FINANCE'S WINDOW.
 *
 * Finance is the ONE reporting scope whose default window is not the current
 * month: you cannot charge back a month in progress, so a bare
 * `/reporting?scope=finance` shows the LAST COMPLETE month. Its teammate drill
 * links were built from `useDrillWindow()`, which reads the raw `useReportState`
 * keys — all null in that default state. The link therefore carried no `month`,
 * and `drill-contract`'s `frameWindow()` correctly filled in the CURRENT month:
 * a row of July money opening an August page (different data), or a 403 when
 * the subject has no August row in the frame.
 *
 * The window a link carries must be the window the figures beside it were read
 * at — so it is derived from the SAME computed the two fetches bind on.
 *
 * ── MIGRATED BY F1 (clock-rot-audit.md §F-a) ────────────────────────────────
 * The expectations here were `lastCompleteMonth()` / `currentMonth()`
 * re-implemented from the component and reading `new Date()` — the only test
 * documenting the finance default-window contract, written against the browser
 * clock it was documenting. The clock is stubbed now, so the months are
 * literals: "July, because the pinned server day is in August".
