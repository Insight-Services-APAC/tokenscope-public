/*
 * /projects — the card sparkline stops at the SETTLED edge (external review).
 *
 * `sparkSeries` walked `denseDays(today, dayOfMonth(today))`, so it zero-filled
 * every elapsed day INCLUDING today — a day the server has not finished
 * measuring — and `MonthSpark` then drew the line down to the baseline on it.
 * That is the morning dip F1 exists to remove, rebuilt one layer up: NULL is
 * not 0, and an empty partial day is silence, not a measured zero.
 *
 * A settled day with no rows IS a measured zero and is still filled. Today is
 * admitted only when it CARRIES data, and only then is the endpoint drawn
 * hollow ("still accruing").
 *
 * Mounting idiom: my-projects-list.test.ts, with the REAL MonthSpark — the
 * drawing is the finding, so a stub would prove nothing.
