/*
 * The unhomed cause-split PANEL invariants (app/pages/admin/diagnostics.vue).
 *
 * WHY SOURCE-LEVEL rather than a mount: the same reasoning as
 * tests/unit/pages/admin-grants.test.ts. What is being protected here is not
 * "what one fixture renders" but properties of the TEMPLATE that must hold on
 * every code path — including the ones a fixture would not reach:
 *
 *   - the card shows exactly ONE unhomed total, so the split can never be read
 *     against a second figure;
 *   - a non-zero residual SUPPRESSES the breakdown rather than rendering four
 *     plausible numbers that do not add up;
 *   - every zero on the panel carries a state an operator (and QA) can tell
 *     apart: "none" is not "we could not look" is not "not applicable";
 *   - the visibility block reuses the existing scope vocabulary instead of
 *     inventing a parallel one.
 *
 * A mount test would assert the first of these for one set of props and say
 * nothing about the rest. Every assertion below was mutation-proven: edit the
 * template to violate it and the test fails (see the suite's commit message for
 * the list).
