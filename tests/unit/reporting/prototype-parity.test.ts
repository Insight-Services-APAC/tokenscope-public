/*
 * prototype-parity — the gate that can actually fail.
 *
 * ── WHY ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Build agents were told to "match the prototype" and reviewers were told to
 * verify against it, and nine of the fifteen surfaces the approved prototype
 * puts on the cost-centre page were still absent. The cause was mechanical, not
 * careless: the prototype is executable JS, so a page's surface list is only
 * discoverable by RUNNING it, and every check anyone ran started from the build
 * ("does the build have X?") — which can confirm presence and is structurally
 * incapable of detecting absence.
 *
 * This gate runs the other way. `inventory.json` is emitted from the approved
 * prototype (scripts/emit-prototype-inventory.mjs); every surface it records
 * must be answered for HERE, in `parity-map.json`, with one of:
 *
 *   { "built": "ComponentName" }   the scope's component tree must contain it
 *   { "built": { "text": "..." } } the tree's source must contain that string
 *   { "missing": "why" }           an ACKNOWLEDGED GAP — this test FAILS
 *   { "waived": { reason, decision } }  an owner ruling that it does not belong
 *
 * `missing` failing is the point. A gap cannot be quiet: it either gets built,
 * or somebody writes down the decision that it should not be.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS GATE DOES NOT PROVE, STATED PLAINLY ────────────────────────────
 * It resolves the component TREE. It proves a surface is WIRED INTO a scope, not
 * that it renders — a component behind a `v-if` that is never true still
 * satisfies set membership, and so would an unused import. Saying otherwise
 * would make this gate the very thing it exists to catch: an artefact claiming a
 * guarantee it does not deliver.
 *
 * The one gap that bit immediately is LANE gating, so that half is closed here:
 * the inventory records which lanes the prototype draws a surface in, and a
 * build that shows it in fewer must declare `lanes` and say why. Anything
 * narrower than a lane — a `v-if` on data, on a grant, on a feature flag —
 * this gate cannot see, and the coverage walk (docs/development/coverage-loop.md)
 * is the check that can.

 * are deliberately dropped — and a module-scope read then failed the whole FILE
