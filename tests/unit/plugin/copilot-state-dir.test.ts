/**
 * The Copilot lane resolves ONE credential store (audit round 2, follow-up to the
 * "durable Copilot credential store is anchored on the passwd home" fix).
 *
 * `~/.tokenscope/config.json` holds `oauth_refresh_token`. Anchoring it on the PASSWD
 * home closed a trust hole — `os.homedir()` consults `$HOME`, so a leaked or model-set
 * `HOME` chose where a live credential was written — but it was applied to the WRITER
 * (copilot-redeem.mjs) and one reader (device-id.mjs) only. The forwarder, the
 * emit-on-install enrol door, the lifecycle hook's log, status and landed-check were
 * left on `os.homedir()`, so on any host where `$HOME` differs from the passwd home
 * redeem wrote one path and the forwarder opened another — Copilot emission stopping
 * SILENTLY, which is the exact incident recorded in real-home.mjs's header.
 *
 * These tests pin the whole lane on one resolution: a `TOKENSCOPE_STATE_DIR` pin
 * first, else `~/.tokenscope` under the passwd home.
 *
 * WHY THE ASSERTIONS ARE ON THE RESOLVED PATH rather than on a real write: the
 * no-override path resolves the developer's OWN ~/.tokenscope, and a unit test must
 * never read or write a live deployment. Every resolver here is a pure path
 * computation, so pinning the value pins the behaviour.
