/*
 * casWriteFile — the one read-modify-write used by every writer of
 * ~/.claude/settings.json.
 *
 * WHY IT MATTERS. settings.json holds the durable emit refresh token. Each writer
 * used to read it, compute, and rename its own snapshot over whatever was there.
 * A hook or a status-line toggle could therefore rename a STALE snapshot over a
 * token a redeem had just rotated, silently rolling the credential back to one
 * that may since have been revoked.
 *
 * WHY NOT A LOCK. `~/.claude` is a host bind-mount shared by every container, and
 * each container has its own PID namespace, so a lockfile's usual stale-holder
 * check ("is that pid alive?") is meaningless across writers. A wedged lock on
 * this file would stop every session on the host, which is worse than the race.
 * See the function's own header.
