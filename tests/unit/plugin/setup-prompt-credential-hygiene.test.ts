 * setup-prompt-credential-hygiene — S16b.
 *
 * The product's own setup prompts used to instruct the AI agent to OPEN the file
 * that holds this device's durable emit credential, purely to fish one non-secret
 * field out of it:
 *
 *   ~/.claude/settings.json    env.OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES (the instance id) is a
 *                              SIBLING KEY of env.TOKENSCOPE_OAUTH_REFRESH_TOKEN
 *                              (plugin/scripts/claude-redeem.mjs writes both into
 *                              one `env` object).
 *   ~/.tokenscope/config.json  instance_id is a FLAT SIBLING of oauth_refresh_token
 *                              (plugin/scripts/copilot-redeem.mjs writes both).
 *
 * That fired on the NORMAL setup flow — no attacker, every device — and pulled a
 * long-lived credential into the model's context and the session transcript. The
 * fix is plugin/scripts/device-id.mjs: it reads the store out-of-process and
 * prints only non-secret fields, so every prompt can name a COMMAND instead of a
 * credential-bearing file.
 *
 * These assertions pin that across ALL FIVE setup-prompt surfaces, because the
 * same instruction was duplicated into each of them and a fix that reached only
 * one is the failure mode this file exists to catch:
 *   1. plugin/commands/setup.md                        (Claude client copy)
 *   2. docs/skills/tokenscope/tokenscope-setup.md      (server skill SOURCE)
 *   3. server/utils/skill-prompts.gen.ts               (GENERATED, served over MCP)
 *   4. server/utils/mcp.ts provision_emit descriptions (tool + instance_id param)
 *   5. copilot-plugin/skills/tokenscope-setup/SKILL.md (Copilot lane)
