// @vitest-environment node
/*
 * otel-headers-helper.sh — the DESTINATION comes from the device, not the
 * environment (MDASH F120 / F119 / F309).
 *
 * WHY. Claude Code invokes this helper itself, roughly every 29 minutes, with
 * its own repo-merged environment. That is exactly why the state dir was moved
 * onto argv — a channel a settings file cannot contribute to. The endpoints were
 * left behind: `TOKENSCOPE_OAUTH_TOKEN_ENDPOINT` is where the DURABLE,
 * non-rotating refresh token is POSTed (ADR-0005: revocation is the only
 * control), and `TOKENSCOPE_BEARER_ENDPOINT` is the same defect one credential
 * down — the access token in an Authorization header. The attacker never needed
 * the credential, only somewhere to send it, because `assert_safe_endpoint`
 * validates the SCHEME only: every https host was accepted, unpinned.
 *
 * The fix gives the helper a trusted source to prefer — `${STATE_DIR}/config.json`,
 * the device's own 0700 store, already the trusted source for the refresh token.
 *
 * These drive the REAL scripts with a recording `curl` stub, because the claim
 * is about where the shipped file actually sends a credential.
