/*
 * T2 — the three quantities stay distinct at the edge.
 *
 * `now`, `today` and `settledThrough` are three different facts, and the
 * codebase conflated the last two: SQL's `GREATEST(CURRENT_DATE, MAX(day))`
 * pulled every chart's right edge onto the WALL CLOCK, where the axis needs a
 * COVERAGE fact. The gap between them is the morning dip. These assertions exist
 * so a later "simplification" that collapses `settledThrough` back onto `today`
 * — which looks harmless, and reads as a one-day off-by-one — goes red.
 *
 * Also pins the pure derivations, because `dayOfMonth` is the DIVISOR behind
 * every project card's "on pace for ~$X": it is the one clock-shaped value in
 * this codebase that reaches money.
