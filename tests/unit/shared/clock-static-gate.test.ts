/*
 * T5 — no clock read survives in a windowing or labelling path.
 *
 * WHY A STATIC GATE AND NOT A BEHAVIOURAL TEST. `clock-rot-audit.md` §F is the
 * argument: the suite runs entirely at `TZ=UTC`, so `getDate()` and
 * `getUTCDate()` are currently the same function and every local-vs-UTC defect
 * is invisible BY CONSTRUCTION. Worse, this defect class is not a timezone bug
 * at all — the offenders already use correct UTC arithmetic. It is OWNERSHIP: a
 * second clock that can disagree with the first. Two clocks agreeing today is
 * indistinguishable, behaviourally, from one clock. Only the source can tell.
 *
 * Five of these surfaces had ZERO test signal of any kind (§F-b) — they would
 * have regressed silently, with no red test and no green one.
 *
 * WHAT IT BANS, in files whose job is to decide or label a window:
 *   - `new Date()` with no argument, and `Date.now()`   → the browser's clock
 *   - `CURRENT_DATE` / `NOW()` in SQL                   → the database's clock,
 *     a THIRD one, and the actual mechanism of the morning dip
 *
 * WHAT IT ALLOWS: `new Date(<something>)`. Parsing a server-supplied day or
 * formatting an instant is not a clock read.
 *
 * ADDING A FILE HERE IS THE POINT. The list is the slice's own perimeter, and it
 * only grows.
