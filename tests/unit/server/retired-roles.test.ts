/*
 * The retirement invariant for `global-finops` (2026-09-05) and `finance`.
 *
 * Both stay in `ROLES` so a historical `teammate.role` row still renders a label
 * instead of a raw enum code — which means the enum ALONE cannot tell you they
 * are dead. These assertions are what makes the retirement true: a stray holder
 * must land on the least-privilege tier and reach nothing, and nobody may mint
 * one.
 *
 * Written because the per-route "global-finops is also rejected 403" cases this
 * replaces asserted the boundary once per endpoint and would still have passed
 * if the role had quietly kept a capability somewhere else.
