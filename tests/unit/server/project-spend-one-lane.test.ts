/*
 * THE CALL-SITE CONTRACT for "project spend this month".
 *
 * `tests/integration/reports/known-outcome-validation.test.ts` proves the shared
 * helper computes the right number. That is helper correctness, and it is NOT
 * call-site coverage: it calls `completeProjectSpend` directly, so reverting the
 * project page, the /projects cards, the budget editor, the manager rollup, the
 * cost-centre card or the budget alert to `attribution_aggregate` or the raw
 * ledger leaves it GREEN and ships six surfaces quoting different money.
 *
 * This file closes that gap statically: every producer of a project-spend figure
 * must OBTAIN it from server/usage/complete-spend.ts and must contain no second
 * source it could obtain it from instead. A source-level contract rather than
 * six end-to-end fixtures, because the failure being guarded is a change to
 * WHICH SOURCE a call site reads — visible in the source, and cheap enough to
 * run on every commit rather than only when a container is available.
 *
 * Comments are stripped first, so a doc comment explaining what a file used to
 * read ("it was a SUM over attribution_record here") is not a false positive.
 * The counts are pinned deliberately: a new read of any of these tables inside a
 * producer is a decision that has to be argued for in review, not one that
 * lands quietly.
