/*
 * drizzle/provision-app-role.ts, run as the entrypoint runs it.
 *
 * WHY A CHILD PROCESS AND NOT AN IMPORTED FUNCTION. The thing that has to be
 * true of this script is a CONTRACT WITH `entrypoint.sh`: `node
 * node_modules/.bin/tsx drizzle/provision-app-role.ts` must exit 0 and touch
 * nothing when the opt-in variable is absent, because that is what every deploy
 * will do until somebody deliberately opts in — and it must exit 3, not 1, when
 * the runtime's own credential is broken, because that is the code the
 * entrypoint aborts boot on. An imported function cannot certify any of that: it
 * skips the env gate, the exit code and the logging, which is the entire surface
 * the entrypoint sees. So every case below spawns the real command line with a
 * controlled environment.
 *
 * THE CUTOVER SWEEP IS NOT HERE ANY MORE. It is `drizzle/cutover-rls-sweep.ts`
 * and `tests/integration/db/cutover-rls-sweep.test.ts`, because its TRIGGER was
 * wrong three adversarial rounds running while it was a side effect of this
 * step. This file's job is now exactly one thing: the ROLE. It asserts that
 * provisioning leaves RLS posture untouched; what the posture SHOULD be is the
 * other file's question.
 *
 * The properties this file exists to hold:
 *   1. DORMANT ONLY WHEN NOBODY ASKED. No opt-in → nothing created, nothing
 *      changed, exit 0. Opt-in WITHOUT a password → exit non-zero, named — and
 *      exit 3, not 1, when the runtime is already pointed at the role.
 *   1b. DORMANT IS NOT BLIND. With `TOKENSCOPE_APP_DATABASE_URL` set — the
 *      `useAppRoleAtRuntime` + no-`provisionAppRole` combination Bicep permits —
 *      a broken runtime credential is still exit 3, not a silent boot into 503s.
 *   2. CORRECT. Opt-in → a non-owner LOGIN role that can really read and write,
 *      including into tables that did not exist when it was granted.
 *   2b. AND IT NEVER TOUCHES RLS. Not on any path, not for any ledger state.
 *   3. WRITES THE API LANE. `provider_usage_fact` is written by the
 *      provider-transform worker, which authenticates as this very role.
 *   4. CONVERGED. A role that already exists carrying SUPERUSER / BYPASSRLS /
 *      INHERIT is brought to the promised posture, not trusted — and one that
 *      can REACH a table owner by a grant shape Postgres HONOURS is refused
 *      BEFORE anything is written, while one that holds a grant Postgres does
 *      NOT honour is provisioned normally.
 *   5. THE PASSWORD IS SET ONCE, WHEN THE ROLE IS CREATED. A later boot never
 *      moves it. `TOKENSCOPE_ROTATE_APP_DB_PASSWORD=true` is the only path that
 *      does, and it is off by default.
 *   6. ATOMIC, AND SERIALISED. A failure part-way leaves the password and the
 *      grants exactly as they were, and two replicas cannot interleave.
 *   7. BOUNDED. The deadline really fires mid-run, and when it does the run goes
 *      through the SAME credential classifier and exit path as any other
 *      failure — it used to `process.exit` straight out of the timer.
 *   8. QUIET. The password never appears in the output — and never reaches the
 *      server either.

 * regardless, so diagnostics said yes and provisioning failed.
 *
 * The fixture reproduces it precisely:
 *   - a login role with NEITHER superuser NOR createrole,
 *   - membership of a CREATEROLE role it MAY `SET ROLE` to,
 *   - and the table owner's OBJECT privileges by inheritance (`WITH INHERIT
 *     TRUE, SET FALSE`), because the grants and the RLS sweep run as the owner
 *     after `RESET ROLE` — SET ROLE replaces the privilege set rather than
 *     adding to it, so leaving it on would silently grant nothing.
