 * Integration-test DB helper — testcontainers-backed Postgres.
 *
 * Per AGENTS.md anti-pattern §"Never mock Drizzle — use a real test DB
 * via testcontainers". Each test file spins up its own container and
 * runs migrations once. Slow but honest.
 *
 * Container image is `postgres:16` so the test environment matches prod
 * (data-model.md is PG-16-specific).
 *
 * TEST_PG_URL escape hatch: environments with NO container runtime (e.g. a
 * devcontainer without a docker/podman socket) can point TEST_PG_URL at any
 * PG-16 server with ltree/pgcrypto/btree_gist available; each suite then
 * provisions its own throwaway database there — same real-PG16 +
 * full-migrations honesty, per-suite isolation preserved.

 * PRODUCTION'S CONNECTION CONFIG, and the suite now runs it.
 *
 * `server/db/index.ts` pins `connection: { TimeZone: 'UTC' }` on the pool that
 * serves every request and every in-process worker. That single line is what
 * holds ~23 bare `timestamptz::date` day-bucket casts correct
 * (`clock-rot-audit.md` §A) — they are LATENT, not broken, and the fix is this
 * pin plus a test, not 23 query rewrites.
 *
 * These helpers omitted it, so 237 integration tests ran a connection
 * configuration production does not use. Two consequences, both bad: the suite
 * could not catch a session-TZ bug, and DELETING THE PRODUCTION PIN TURNED ZERO
 * TESTS RED. `tests/integration/db/utc-pin.test.ts` closes the second half;
 * this closes the first.
 *
 * `postgres.js` sends `connection:` keys as wire-protocol STARTUP PARAMETERS, so
 * this applies to every physical connection the pool opens, reconnects included.
 *
 * ── AND THE WORKER LANE'S RLS IDENTITY ──────────────────────────────────────
 * `t.db` is the handle every worker integration test hands to `runXxx(t.db)`, so
 * it is a worker-handle mint site (docs/design/rls-enforcement.md §2, site 7)
 * and carries the lane's `app.user_role=global-finops` GUC — imported from
 * `server/db/worker-db.ts`, never re-spelled here, so the suite cannot certify
 * an identity production does not use.
 *
 * This does NOT weaken the RLS tests. They connect as a separate NON-OWNER role
 * with its own client (`rls.test.ts`, `aggregate-rollup.test.ts`), and
 * `withRlsContext`'s `SET LOCAL` still narrows a connection carrying a
 * connection-level default — measured, design §1.
