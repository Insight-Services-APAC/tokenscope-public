/*
 * Residual placement freezes at first write (issue #44).
 *
 * ── THE DEFECT ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `unaccounted_usage` refreshed `region_id` / `org_unit_id` from the teammate's
 * CURRENT placement on every recompute, over a trailing 35-day window. So a
 * residual row followed the person for 35 days and then froze wherever it
 * happened to be when the window rolled past it. `Data-Lineage.md` called that
 * "not any coherent policy", which was exact: the same teammate-day could sit
 * in two org units depending on when you asked.
 *
 * ── WHY IT BLOCKS THE PLACEMENT CORRECTION ───────────────────────────────────
 * An admin correcting placement from July onwards would have JUNE rewritten to
 * the new unit by the next worker tick — within the hour, silently. The date
 * floor is not a floor while this is live, so this must land before the
 * correction feature, not after.
 *
 * `actual_spend` has always omitted the dimensions from its ON CONFLICT list;
 * this brings the residual tables into line with it.

 * OTel rows, a 35-day window — to observe one clause. The clause IS the
 * invariant, and the failure mode is somebody adding a line to it, so the
 * assertion reads the statement. Its weakness is named rather than hidden: this
 * cannot catch placement being refreshed by some OTHER statement.
