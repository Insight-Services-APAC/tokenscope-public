/*
 * The shared reporting engine must never serve the WRONG scope.
 *
 * across-regions.ts is regional.ts with the scope predicate deleted — 7 of 12
 * paired query functions are >=70% line-identical once naming and the predicate
 * are normalised away — so every fix had to be applied twice, and the two
 * copies had already drifted (their (day, lane) map-key separators differed).
 * Consolidating them removes that, but introduces a hazard the copies did not
 * have: ONE implementation now answers for both scopes, so a mistake in how the
 * clamp is threaded is a mistake in whose money is reported.
 *
 * The two failures that matter are opposites:
 *   - a REGIONAL caller losing its clamp reports the whole company's spend
 *     under one region's name — a cross-region data leak on a governance
 *     surface;
 *   - a WHOLE-COMPANY caller inheriting a clamp silently under-reports the
 *     company total, which nothing else on the page would contradict.
 *
 * Both are asserted here against real data in two regions, on numbers that
 * differ, so either mistake is a wrong FIGURE rather than a wrong shape.
