/*
 * The coverage denominator published beside a reporting total ("Four — make
 * reports honest about coverage", docs/design/reporting-stakeholder-visibility/
 * 00-decisions.md §5b):
 *   - GET /reports/across-regions → `budgetCoverage` (whole company)
 *   - GET /reports/regional       → `budgetCoverage` (region-clamped)
 *
 * WHY THE FIXTURE LOOKS LIKE THIS. Every bucket carries a DIFFERENT amount, and
 * the two regions differ from each other and from the company in ALL FIVE figures.
 * A wrong denominator is then a wrong NUMBER rather than a wrong shape: a dropped
 * clamp, a swallowed arm, a budget predicate that ignores the window or the scope
 * axis, a $0 allocation admitted as a budget, a per-developer cap dismissed as not
 * a budget, or a fanned-out allocation join each land on a value no other bucket
 * carries.
 *
 * The identity under test is that the four parts PARTITION the surface's own
 * attributed-usage headline. That is the whole point of the qualifier — a
 * coverage figure that does not foot to the total it sits beside is worse than
 * none, because a reader would reconcile it against the tile above and fail.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT asserted: that the denominator is all enterprise consumption.
 * It is not, and the copy does not claim it is — provider spend that has never
 * matched a teammate reaches no §A row, so it is in neither the headline nor
 * this. Asserting completeness we do not deliver is the defect class this
 * codebase keeps re-learning.

/*
 * ── THE FIXTURE, stated as the arithmetic the assertions below check ─────────
 *
 * The window is MARCH 2026 — a month that is closed and will stay closed. That is
 * load-bearing, not incidental: region A's budgets are bounded to March, so a
 * predicate that asked "is there a budget NOW" instead of "was there a budget over
 * this window" answers differently. With the window sitting on the current month
 * the two questions coincide and the window rule cannot be proven.
 *
 * Region A (March 2026)
 *   budgeted           120.00  arm 1, tagged to A-FUNDED (baseline AND top-up AND a
 *                              per-dev cap, all three overlapping March — the
 *                              DISTINCT case)
 *                       37.00  arm 2, tagged to A-FUNDED (the reconciled money that
 *                              dominates at today's adoption)
 *                       50.00  arm 1, tagged to A-TOPUP (a TOP-UP is budget too)
 *                       31.00  arm 1, tagged to A-PERDEV (its ONLY project allocation
 *                              is a per-developer cap — a per-dev cap IS budget)
 *   taggedNoBudget      64.00  arm 1, tagged to A-BARE (no PROJECT allocation ever — it
 *                              carries a REGION-scoped row whose scope_id is A-BARE's
 *                              own uuid, which must not fund it)
 *                       23.00  arm 1, tagged to A-LAPSED (allocation ended before March)
 *                       13.00  arm 1, tagged to A-ZERO (a $0 baseline over March — an
 *                              allocation row, but not a budget)
 *   untagged            11.00  arm 1, no project claim
 *                        6.00  arm 2, no project claim
 *   untaggable           9.00  arm 3 (claude-ai) — no project axis by construction
 *   ─────────────────────────
 *   total              364.00 = 238 budgeted + 100 taggedNoBudget + 17 untagged + 9 untaggable
 *
 *   Plus two rows JUST OUTSIDE the window — 999.00 on the last day of February and
 *   777.00 on the first day of April — so a window that slips by a day at either
 *   end stops matching the headline by an amount nothing else could produce.
 *
 * Region B (March 2026)
 *   budgeted           500.00 · taggedNoBudget 40.00 · untagged 3.00 · untaggable 2.00
 *   total              545.00
 *   B-FUNDED's budget is OPEN-ENDED, so both allocation shapes are represented.
 *
 * ── Region C — the SUBTREE fixture (March 2026) ──────────────────────────────
 * A and B are flat: one org unit each, sitting at their region's root. That shape
 * cannot tell a region-clamped scope from a subtree-clamped one, because the two
 * cover the same rows — so it could never have caught a note naming the region above
 * a subtree's numbers. Region C has a real tree:
 *
 *   Coverage Region C            (path `bcc`, code `default`, PARENTLESS — the region
 *                                 root; a caller placed HERE has their clamp degraded
 *                                 to zero rows by placedBelowRegionRootPredicate)
 *     ├── Platform Engineering   (path `bcc.plat`)  budgeted 70 · untagged 5 → 75
 *     └── Sales Engineering      (path `bcc.sales`) taggedNoBudget 30        → 30
 *   region C total 105.00
 *
 * Every one of those four figures is distinct from every other in the fixture, so
 * "which scope answered" is a different NUMBER, not a different shape: a subtree
 * caller who was silently given the region reads 105 where they should read 75.
 *
 * Whole company       1014.00 = 808 budgeted + 170 taggedNoBudget + 25 untagged + 11 untaggable
