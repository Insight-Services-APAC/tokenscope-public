 * needs cannot live under server/: it would resolve in dev and be missing in
 * production. `server/db/rls-bootstrap.ts` re-exports RLS_APP_ROLE so
 * server-side code still has one obvious import site beside
 * RLS_BOOTSTRAP_TABLES.
 *
 * Deliberately import-free so that reading a role name never drags a database

 *
 * IT IS NOT WHAT DECIDES WHAT MAY BE SWEPT. That is a separate, un-overridable

 *
 * Returns one `rolname` column, ordered, suitable for wrapping in `ARRAY(…)`.
 *
 * ── WHY `'SET'` AND NOT `'MEMBER'` OR `'USAGE'` — MEASURED, NOT ASSUMED ──────
 * Measured on PostgreSQL 16.13 (the version `docker-compose.yml`,
 * `tests/integration/helpers/db.ts` and `infra/modules/postgresql.bicep` all
 * pin), with `GRANT grp TO usr WITH SET FALSE` — PG 16's new option:
 *
 *   grant shape                  MEMBER  USAGE  SET   `SET ROLE grp` really…
 *   ---------------------------  ------  -----  ----  ----------------------
 *   default (SET TRUE, NOINHERIT)   t       f     t    succeeds
 *   WITH SET FALSE  (NOINHERIT)     t       f     f    ERROR 'permission denied to set role'
 *   WITH INHERIT TRUE, SET FALSE    t       t     f    ERROR 'permission denied to set role'
 *
 * So `MEMBER` reports a capability the server refuses, and `USAGE` is wrong in
 * BOTH directions — false for the working case, true for the forbidden one.
 * `USAGE` answers "are this role's OBJECT privileges inherited", which is a
 * different question again: role ATTRIBUTES are never inherited (measured: a
 * member with `INHERIT TRUE` still gets `ERROR: permission denied to create
 * role`), so inheritance cannot make `CREATEROLE` usable at all — only `SET
 * ROLE` can. `pg_has_role(…, 'SET')` also follows indirect grant chains
 * (measured), which a `pg_auth_members.set_option` join would have to walk by
 * hand.
 *
 * REQUIRES PostgreSQL 16+: the `SET` privilege type was added alongside
 * `GRANT … WITH SET`. On an older server this errors rather than lying, which is
 * the right failure for a capability probe.
