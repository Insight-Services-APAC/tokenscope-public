/**
 * Where a budget will LAND at month end — the basis behind the per-project pill
 * on the dashboard.
 *
 * `ragOf` above answers a different question: what share of the budget is gone
 * right now. On a budget row that is the wrong question, because it has no
 * calendar in it: 90% of a budget on day 28 is a month that finishes about on
 * plan, and 90% on day 5 is a month that finishes at roughly six times the
 * budget, and raw percent calls both of them the same thing. Every project on
 * the dashboard read "Healthy" as a result — including one at $0.00 of $500,
 * where nothing had happened at all.
 *
 * The words, colours and position of the pill are unchanged; only this basis is
 * new. Kept a PURE function of four numbers so the truth table is testable
 * without a component (tests/unit/components/budget-pace.test.ts).
 *
 *   over         already over the allocation — a FACT; a top-up flips it
 *   pace-over    not over yet, but on this pace will be — a FORECAST
 *   warning      on this pace, finishes at 85-100% of the allocation
 *   healthy      on this pace, finishes under 85% of the allocation
 *   not-started  an allocation, and nothing spent against it yet
 *   no-budget    no allocation to measure against
 *
 * `over` and `pace-over` were ONE state (both returned 'over') until D8 split
 * them: a fact and a forecast wearing the same word meant the pill could not
 * say which of two things it meant, and a reader could not tell whether a
 * top-up was already needed or merely likely to be.
 *
 * `daysElapsed` is the DAY OF THE MONTH (`RunRate.days_elapsed`), so month-to-
 * date spend is the running total at the END of that day and the elapsed
 * fraction is `daysElapsed / daysInMonth` — 1 on the last day, where the
 * projection correctly degenerates to the actual.
