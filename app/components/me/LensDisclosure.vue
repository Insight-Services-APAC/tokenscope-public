/*
 * MeLensDisclosure — why a dollar does or does not reach a cost centre
 * (ADR 0012 decision 5).
 *
 * TWO VARIANTS, BOTH BEHIND AN AFFORDANCE (owner ruling 2026-08-05). The
 * page-body CARD this component started as — three scalars over a four-line
 * paragraph, headed "What is and is not chargeable" — is RETIRED from /usage:
 * the three scalars are already answered better by the lane toggle, the hero
 * tiles (the lead tile becomes Chargeable in the billed lane, with Attributed
 * usage beside it) and the settlement/coverage chip row, and the paragraph
 * violated the standing dashboard-prose ruling (visuals tell the story;
 * explanations open on demand). The INFORMATION did not die with it — it moved
 * behind the `dot` variant, an InfoDot on the lane toggle, compressed to the
 * sentences a reader needs at the moment they ask.
 *
 * The two lenses can disagree by a lot: one developer's July was $6,846.35 of
 * attributed usage against $1,449.70 the providers reported and about $6 that
 * actually cross-charges. That gap is past the over-emission detector's
 * materiality threshold — but the subscription behind it is DECLARED, and the
 * declaration's own copy promises that declared usage "is never flagged as
 * suspicious for having no Insight bill behind it". So the thing owed to the
 * reader is not an alarm, it is the explanation: how much of the month's
 * attributed usage is declared-personal, and what that does and does not do.
 *
 * PRECISION MATTERS HERE, because the obvious sentence is false. Migration
 * 0105:16-19 states it outright: "A declaration NEVER changes an actual_spend
 * chargeback verdict. Provider API records remain governed exclusively by
 * provider_org.billing or provider_enterprise.billing (ADR-0011 D1), including
 * when provider-backed and personal usage coexist for the same teammate and
 * tool." So a declaration suppresses the no-bill over-emission query and
 * nothing else. Declared usage escapes chargeback only when there is no
 * provider bill behind it — which is usually true for a personal subscription
 * and is NOT a property the declaration confers.
 *
 * PER TOOL, not per account. A declaration explains only the tool it names
 * (`personal_subscription_declaration` is scoped to one tool), so the server
 * classifies each tool against its own declaration and its own provider record
 * and hands them over as `tool_gaps`. A declared Claude subscription therefore
 * cannot swallow an undeclared Copilot over-emission — both sentences render.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO (decision 6): it does not hedge the
 * headline. It never says the usage figure is notional, provisional, or should
 * be discounted. The tokens were consumed; the product exists to change
 * behaviour before the invoice catches up. This block discloses what is and is
 * not chargeable — it does not undermine the primary figure.
 *
 * The per-tool sentences render only when there is something true to say: an
 * active declaration, a tool whose gap the detector itself would consider
 * material, or a tool with no provider record behind a month of usage.
