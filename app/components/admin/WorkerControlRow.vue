 * small but it makes CLAIMS to an operator, and a review caught it making two
 * false ones at once: it rendered a cron for a worker that has no cron job, and
 * offered an enable/disable toggle for a worker that never ticks. Both looked
 * fine in the template and neither could fail a test, because the markup lived
 * inline in a page that cannot be mounted without Nuxt data plumbing.
 *
 * The rule this encodes: `scheduled === false` means NO Container Apps job
 * exists, so there is nothing to turn on or off. Show that plainly instead of
 * implying control that does not exist.
