/*
 * DefaultUnitClustersDialog — the to-do list behind the catch-all warning (C9).
 *
 * A `(default)` unit holding hundreds of people is not a placement success. It is
 * the org tree reporting which units have no owner: those people landed there
 * because the manager-chain walk climbed past their own manager, found no nearer
 * owner, and hit the catch-all at the top — while every downstream report reads
 * them as "placed".
 *
 * SO THIS IS A TO-DO LIST, NOT A SCOLD. The occupants who do not belong are
 * grouped by THEIR OWN manager — "12 report to Lee Hughes" — because each cluster
 * is one concrete action: make that manager an owner of the cost centre their team
 * belongs to, or place the cluster by hand from the worklist. Every one the admin
 * does subtracts itself from the number above, which is the property that makes a
 * warning get used instead of dismissed.
 *
 * "NOT LOOKED UP" IS ITS OWN NUMBER, deliberately. A teammate whose manager has
 * never been captured is not evidence of a misplacement — we have not asked. It is
 * shown separately, with the action that actually fixes it (a placement pass),
 * rather than inflating a warning that no amount of assigning owners could reduce.
 *
 * ── THE ADVICE IS NOT OFFERED WHERE IT WOULD BACKFIRE ─────────────────────────
 * "Make that manager an owner" is only a fix while the manager owns NOTHING else.
 * Give an existing owner a second active cost centre and the chain walk can no
 * longer tell which of the two a report belongs to: it skips them entirely and
 * they place nobody — on the new unit OR the one they already owned. That is the
 * ambiguity the region page's own ⚠ warning exists to flag, so proposing it here
 * would be one screen telling an admin to create what another screen calls a
 * misconfiguration. `manager_owns_unit_count` comes back per cluster and the
 * action is replaced, for those rows, by the reason it is not on offer.
