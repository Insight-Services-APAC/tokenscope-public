/*
 * ReResolvePlacementDialog — apply the current placement configuration to the
 * people who already exist in this region (spec C7).
 *
 * PREVIEW FIRST, ALWAYS. Opening runs a DRY RUN: how many would move, and to
 * where. Nothing is written until the admin clicks Apply, and the endpoint's
 * `dry_run` defaults to true so a mis-shaped request cannot skip that.
 *
 * ── THE ORDERING TRAP, ON SCREEN ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Re-resolving re-derives against CURRENT configuration. If nothing can place
 * anyone yet — no unambiguous cost-centre owner, no unit rule pointing into this
 * region — everyone is re-derived straight back onto the holding node and the
 * admin concludes the feature is broken. So the server answers that question
 * first and returns `routes.viable`, and when it is false this dialog says FIX
 * THE CONFIGURATION FIRST and disables Apply rather than running to no effect.
 *
 * That verdict is the server's, computed from the very maps the run would use.
 * Re-deriving it here from the tree would be a second opinion that can disagree
 * with the thing it is describing — and "an owner exists" is not the same claim
 * as "an owner the walk can actually use", which is the one that matters.
 *
 * ── BATCHED, AND HONEST ABOUT IT ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Each pass is capped (Graph manager hops inside an HTTP request), so the
 * response carries `remaining` / `more`. The dialog shows cumulative progress and
 * keeps offering the next pass instead of pretending one click finished the job.
