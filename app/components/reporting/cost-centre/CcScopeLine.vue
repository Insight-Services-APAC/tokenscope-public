/*
 * CcScopeLine — WHICH COST CENTRE THIS PAGE IS ABOUT (F5 D23).
 *
 * ── THE DEFECT IT CLOSES ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The Cost-centre tab shipped with no scope statement and no selector: its
 * title said "Cost centres", its KPI subtitle said "across 38 cost centres",
 * and a cost-centre owner had no way to tell what they were looking at — or to
 * reach their own centre, which was behind a click inside a table they had no
 * reason to read as a door.
 *
 *   `R:551-559`, note `scope` — *"The Cost-centre tab lands ON a cost centre.
 *   There is no unscoped state, and never was. The reader arrives already
 *   scoped — crumb above, centre named beside the window — because 'which cost
 *   centre am I looking at' must never be a question this page leaves open."*
 *
 * ── THREE RULES, ALL FROM THE DRAWING ────────────────────────────────────────
 * 1. THE LABEL IS THE SERVER's. `scopeLabel` comes from `report.scope`, which
 *    the endpoint derives from the very resolver that clamped the cards. A view
 *    that composed its own from a route param would name a scope the server may
 *    not have served (`ScopeHero.vue:102-108` records that failure for regions).
 * 2. ONE OPTION IS NOT A SELECTOR, IT IS A LABEL (`region-options.ts:63-65`,
 *    and `R:553-555` in these words exactly). A reader holding one centre gets
 *    the NAME, and no control.
 * 3. IT RENDERS IN BOTH STATES — scoped and unscoped — so the architecture
 *    switch is never silent. A scope line that appeared only once a centre was
 *    chosen would leave the pre-scope state looking exactly like the unlabelled
 *    page this fix is about.
 *
 * PURE + prop-driven: the URL write (`?cc=`, already a first-class key —
 * `useReportState.ts:72-82`) is the container's, through `select`.
