/*
 * CcHeaderNotes — the Cost-centres top layer's caveat chips (D8b,
 * 07-model-axis-subtraction-build.md: "the top layer stops explaining itself").
 *
 * WHAT IT REPLACES. The header stacked THREE separate settlement chip+text
 * pairs (Anthropic / GitHub Copilot / Usage — one fact, said up to three
 * times), the coverage marker WITH its explanatory sentence, and the
 * point-in-time note: a wall of commentary before the first figure. The same
 * disease #230 cured on the Region width (ReportHeaderNotes); the same cure,
 * with the two rules D8b sets for THIS width:
 *
 *  - ONE settlement chip, on the LEAST-SETTLED state across providers
 *    (r1-M5): any `estimated` → "Estimated"; else any `settling` →
 *    "Settling"; and when every clock is past its settling horizon — NO chip
 *    at all. Its popover lists each provider's own clock exactly as the three
 *    chips rendered it (SettlingStateChip — the same component, from the same
 *    server fields), so the information is kept while the triple repeat goes.
 *    The words are SettlingStateChip's own; the copy bank bans "finalised",
 *    and the chip must never state the page's settlement more confidently
 *    than the weakest clock behind it.
 *  - Coverage stays a chip of its OWN (a real §B caveat, not narration),
 *    compact: the pill alone, its sentence riding the tooltip
 *    (CoverageMarker `compact`). It renders independently of the settlement
 *    chip, so an unclaimed denominator can never go unsignalled just because
 *    the clocks all settled.
 *
 * The point-in-time note and the lane explainer are CONTEXT, not caveats:
 * they ride inside the popover (the same relocation ReportHeaderNotes made —
 * relocated, not reworded) and never summon a chip on their own.
 *
 * `<details>`/`<summary>` rather than a bespoke popover, for ReportHeaderNotes'
 * reasons: keyboard-reachable and toggleable natively, open state exposed to
 * assistive tech without ARIA of our own, and the content is real text in the
 * accessibility tree.
