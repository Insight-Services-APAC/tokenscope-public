/*
 * CcDrill — the per-cost-centre §A USAGE BURN drill (the SAME lane as the budget
 * tracker's card burn: `v_complete_usage WHERE cost_owning_unit_id`). Reached by
 * selecting a row in the tracker; it answers "WHO/WHAT is burning this budget?" and
 * reconciles to the tracker row — including a spender whose current placement has
 * moved (§A homes by emit-time cost_owning_unit_id, so they never vanish).
 *
 * Built to the reporting design language: a burn headline (framed against the CC
 * allocation when set), a slim "Burn by vendor" bar over the §A vendor split
 * (Claude = magenta, Copilot = blue — but Copilot pooled rows carry a NULL
 * cost-owning unit and are excluded here, so the split is usually ~100% Claude),
 * and the two HEROES below.
 *
 * ── THIS IS A CONTROL SURFACE, NOT A READING SURFACE (UX pass, 2026-08-06) ────
 * A cost-centre owner arrives scanning for what needs them, and the page's verb
 * is the over-the-soft-cap card: it is the only thing here that names a person
 * and says what to do about them. Everything above it is context for it, so
 * nothing sits between it and the headline. Three things were removed to get
 * there, each on its own grounds, all recorded at their sites: the per-provider
 * freshness row (the header already states settlement, once), the vendor DONUT
 * (two segments is a sentence, not a graphic), and the §B TierExposureCard (a
 * billed-lane answer on a usage-lane page). Every explanatory sentence the two
 * heroes carried is TRUE and load-bearing — the clamp, the denominator, the lane
 * — so it moved behind an (i) rather than dying: the card body carries data, the
 * prose opens on demand.
 * §B ON THIS PAGE, corrected: the chargeback LANE renders the centre's charge in
 * the headline and Behavioural exposure beneath it. What still lives only in the
 * Finance tab is the invoice-grade chargeback REPORT — this page answers "am I on
 * track" in §B, not "what is on the invoice".
 *
 * ── TWO HEROES, NO PIVOT (04-prototype-delta.md §5b) ─────────────────────────
 * Region and whole-company scope offer an axis selector because at that width the
 * reader is exploring. A cost-centre owner is not: they own exactly two things —
 * the BUDGETS the money went to and the PEOPLE who spent it — and toggling
 * between the only two questions they hold is friction. So both render at once,
 * side by side on a wide screen and stacked on a narrow one, each reusing the
 * SAME DriversTable every other scope reads.
 *
 * NEITHER LIST TRUNCATES. At one cost centre the list IS the population: a
 * ranked top-N hides the budget or the person the owner opened the page to find,
 * and the folded "(all other — N)" row is not something they can act on. The
 * budget axis reads the seam's UNCAPPED population variant
 * (`completeProjectAxisPopulation`) rather than a raised cap, so the ranked seam
 * keeps its meaning on every exploratory surface; the people axis was never
 * capped. DriversTable renders every row it is given.
 *
 * TWO DENOMINATORS, AND THEY DIFFER BY CONSTRUCTION. `budgets` foots to Σ of
 * this centre's own projects; `people` foots to the centre's BURN. Each list is
 * rendered against its OWN headline — see the note each carries.

          WORDED SO IT SURVIVES THE TWO FIGURES COINCIDING. This used to read "a
          DIFFERENT figure from the $X burn above" — which, on any period where
          the two denominators happen to land on the same number, printed the same
          value twice and asserted they differed. Observed on the July demo data
          (both $15,667.21), where it reads as a broken sentence rather than a
          caveat. The claim that does real work is that they are not REQUIRED to
          match; whether they happen to is data, not a contract.

          MODEL TIER — REAL, and shipping (F5). The previous note here said this
          column needed a `model_catalog.tier` primitive "that does not exist".
          IT ALWAYS EXISTED: `model_catalog` is migration 0046, `tier` is
          CHECK-constrained (`0046:128`) and seeded (`0046:138-146`), and two
          engines already join it. What was missing was the DRILL's own server
          measure — `fetchCostCentreTeammateTierMix`, which now resolves each
          model through `resolveTier` (the same function the frontier-share
          detector uses, so the two can never publish different frontier shares)
          and lands an unknown model in `unclassified` as a band of its own.

          The BANDING is still never this component's, and never DriversTable's:
          absence of `tierBreakdown` on a row means "no banded spend for this
          person", which the table renders as "not available" — never as "no
          frontier usage".

             lens and is NOT under chargeback — where the caveat above already
             says the tables "do not add up to it, and are not meant to", while
             this footer claimed a reconciliation to it. Naming the base instead
             of the position is true in both lenses and needs no lane branch;
             it also echoes this table's own "share of cost-centre burn". -->

         (`v_complete_usage`); this is provider-billed (`provider_usage_fact`)
         banded by model tier. The two answer different questions and are never
         summed (consistency contract C2) — which is why the card carries its own
         heading rather than becoming another cut of the drill's drivers. -->

      RESTORED, AND GATED TO THE LANE IT BELONGS TO.

      This card was removed from the cost-centre page by 1ac6a8fd (PR #238). The
      objection was real: a §B BILLED card ("Billed spend banded by the choice")
      on a page whose pill reads "§A · usage lane", and on the July capture it
      spent a full-width block printing "Not banded yet — no Anthropic rows in the
      normalised layer. This is not $0." twice.

      But DELETION was not the answer the objection called for, and it cost more
      than it fixed: the approved prototype draws this card on this scope
      (docs/design/reporting-consolidation/prototype.html, the unconditional tail
      after BAND 2), the removal was recorded only in a comment at its own site,
      and the artefact went on saying otherwise. The owner reasonably believed the
      product matched the drawing they signed off.

      The page HAS a lane toggle, and rule 11 is explicit that a cost-centre owner
      needs both halves of the job — "am I on track" is §B, "what is driving it"
      is §A. So the card renders under the CHARGEBACK lane, where a billed answer
      is the question being asked. That satisfies the lane objection exactly,
      without the artefact and the build disagreeing about what the page is.

      The empty-state complaint is a separate, smaller defect and belongs to the
      card (it should not fill a block to say nothing) — not a reason to delete a
      surface from one scope.
