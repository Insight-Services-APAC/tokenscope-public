/*
 * BudgetCoverageNote — the coverage denominator, rendered beside the §A total it
 * qualifies ("Four — make reports honest about coverage",
 * docs/design/reporting-stakeholder-visibility/00-decisions.md §5b).
 *
 * THE PROBLEM IT CLOSES. Under 5% of enterprise consumption is on a budgeted
 * project, so a reader who sees a total and assumes it is the whole is wrong by
 * more than an order of magnitude — and until this shipped, nothing on screen said
 * so. The all-consumption view is the honest artefact at this adoption level and
 * the budget view is the destination; neither may imply the other's coverage.
 *
 * IT IS A BAR, NOT A PARAGRAPH (prototype "who" note). It used to be three
 * sentences of prose stating four dollar figures and their relationship, which is
 * the "a chart that needs a paragraph is broken" defect with the paragraph as the
 * whole card: a partition of one total into four parts is a picture, and the
 * reader's question — "how much of this is governed?" — is answered by the width
 * of the first segment before any number is read. The four parts still carry
 * their own dollar amounts, because a segment nobody can price is decoration.
 *
 * THE FOUR PARTS FOOT TO THE TOTAL, by construction, not by rounding: they are
 * FILTER aggregates over the one scan that produced `totalUsd`
 * (server/reporting/engine/usage-coverage.ts). So the bar may be drawn as
 * shares of that total without a "other/remainder" fudge segment.
 *
 * NOT A BARE PERCENTAGE. The claim names the denominator in the words a reader
 * reads — whose consumption, over what period, from which lane — because a share
 * with an unnamed denominator is the thing this note exists to prevent.
 *
 * THE SCOPE NAME IS NOT THIS COMPONENT'S TO CHOOSE, and it deliberately has no prop
 * for one. It reads `coverage.scopeLabel`, which the server sets beside the predicate
 * it clamped with. The earlier version took a `denominatorLabel` from its parent, which
 * computed `drill ?? region` — correct for an admin, and wrong for a manager or a
 * developer, whose §A clamp is their `app.user_org_path` SUBTREE
 * (server/auth/org-subtree-scope.ts) even though both hold `regional: 'own-region'`.
 * They read the whole REGION's name above their own subtree's numbers. A component
 * cannot see a SQL predicate, so it cannot be the one to name it (contract C11).
 *
 * AND NOT A COMPLETENESS CLAIM. `totalUsd` is §A ATTRIBUTED usage: provider spend
 * that has never matched a teammate reaches no §A row (shared/reports/types.ts,
 * `UsageBudgetCoverage.totalUsd`), so it is in neither this denominator nor the
 * headline it qualifies. That is stated in one line under the bar rather than
 * left for the Finance tab to reveal — see the note in the template for why it is
 * NOT drawn as a fifth segment.
 *
 * §A ONLY. The four parts are a partition of the scope's ATTRIBUTED-USAGE total;
 * no bill-lane figure is an operand (contract C2). Callers render it in the usage
 * lens only — under a chargeable headline this sentence would be qualifying a
 * number it was not computed from.

        THE CONSEQUENCE, in one line. A reader who is not told this reads the bar as
        a partition of ALL provider spend, and it is not.

        NOT A FIFTH SEGMENT, and that is a data fact rather than a layout choice.
        Provider spend whose actor never matched a teammate is carried only on the
        BILLED lane (`provider_usage_fact.teammate_id IS NULL`, mig 0118) — every
        arm of the §A lane this bar partitions is per-teammate by construction
        (`v_complete_usage`, mig 0113). Drawing it as a segment of this total would
        sum §A and §B (contract C2) and would stop the four parts footing to the
        headline they sit under.

        NO DOLLAR FIGURE, deliberately. The prototype's line names one ("$1,191.07
        has no teammate…") because its fourth SEGMENT is that money. Ours is not:
        our fourth segment is `untaggableUsd` — usage that has a teammate and no
        project axis — and the unmatched money is not in this payload at all. It
        would take a §B read to price it. Naming a figure we have not measured, or
        borrowing the fourth segment's, is the false claim this file's own header
        comment exists to forbid. Task #57 tracks the gap.
