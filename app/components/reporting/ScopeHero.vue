/*
 * ScopeHero — the Region scope's headline + KPI tile row, at BOTH widths.
 *
 * ONE COMPONENT, TWO WIDTHS. This was `AcrossHero`, rendered only at the
 * whole-company width, while the single-region width had its own `RegionalHero`.
 * They drifted exactly as far apart as you would expect: the prototype's fixes 2 /
 * 2a / 2b / 2c / 6 were applied here and not there, so the region width still led
 * with a run-rate projection ("On track for $19,257.50") and still carried a
 * standalone MoM tile, a Tokens tile and an avg-per-user tile, with no median at
 * all. It binds on `ScopeHeroReport` — the fields both payloads carry — so it
 * cannot tell which width it is on, and therefore cannot diverge again.
 *
 * THE HEADLINE IS WHAT WAS ACTUALLY SPENT, not what we think will be. It used to
 * be the month-end run-rate ("On track for $79,701"), with the real attributed
 * usage demoted to a subline — a projection reading as the fact, in the largest
 * type on the page. The hero is now the period, the FIGURE, and what the figure
 * is of:
 *
 *   July 2026 · $39,702.37 · attributed usage · the whole company · month to date · day 14 of 31
 *
 * The run-rate is not deleted — the Spend-trend card still projects it as its
 * dashed month-end tail, from this same `forecast` — it is simply no longer the
 * thing a reader sees first.
 *
 * LANE (§A usage ⇄ §B chargeback — provider-billing-attribution-model.md). The
 * HEADLINE re-lenses: usage shows attributed usage, chargeback shows the
 * chargeable cost-of-record. The four tiles do NOT: both money figures are
 * rendered in both lenses (the "both matter equally" rule) with the active lane's
 * tile emphasised, and the two cohort tiles are §A in both. They are never summed
 * with each other (consistency contract C2) and no tile derives money from a ratio.
 *
 * THE ROW IS FOUR TILES, and each one carries its own delta:
 *   Attributed usage (§A) · Chargeable (§B) · Active people (§A) · Median per person (§A)
 *
 * What went, and why — the prototype's numbered fixes:
 *   fix 2  — the standalone "MoM change" tile is gone. It never said of WHAT, in
 *            a row where two tiles sit on different lanes. Each figure now carries
 *            its own month-on-month, so the basis is unambiguous by construction.
 *   fix 2b — Tokens and Avg-usage/user are gone. Tokens sums units priced orders of
 *            magnitude apart; a mean over this distribution is whoever is heaviest
 *            (on the dev stack, $6,427.50 across TWO people). A median survives —
 *            suppressed below five people, where a "median" names an individual.
 *   fix 2a — Active people counts everyone who SPENT (Σ cost_usd > 0), which is the
 *            same population the median divides by, with the emitting subset as its
 *            own line: people spending vs people emitting through TokenScope is the
 *            rollout gap.
 *   fix 6  — Concentration folded in here. The three percentiles sit under the
 *            median because they are the other half of one question: what does a
 *            typical person spend, and how lopsided is it.
 *
 * Every figure is PROVISIONAL — the settling indicator lives once in the page header.
