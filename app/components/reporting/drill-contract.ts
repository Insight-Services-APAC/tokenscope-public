/*
 * drill-contract — "link or plain text BY GRANT, never a live-looking dead
 * button" (developer pages build D29/D30, fix 7), in ONE place.
 *
 * Every teammate/project name on a reports surface routes its decision through
 * here, and here routes it through the two EXPORTED POLICY RULES
 * (`shared/auth/report-visibility.ts`, D38). No view decides for itself: a
 * per-view `v-if` on a grant is how one surface eventually offers a door another
 * surface 403s, which is the defect the contract exists to remove (r1-H4).
 *
 * ── THE TWO RULES ARE NOT ONE ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `namedContributionRow` decides whether a subject may be NAMED; this module
 * decides whether that name is a LINK. A name can be named and still be plain
 * text — a project member sees their team-mates named on the member-depth table
 * and holds no reports grant at all, so none of those names is a door.
 *
 * ── WHAT RIDES THE LINK (D30) ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `?src=` (the entry scope token) plus the entry WINDOW in the report vocabulary
 * (`month` XOR `from`/`to`). The target echoes both in its provenance line and
 * reconstructs the entry report URL for its breadcrumb — never `history.back()`,
 * which breaks on refresh and on a shared link.

 *
 * IT IS NOT ALWAYS TRUE, AND THE DEFAULT IS NOT A LICENCE (r3-M4). A surface
 * whose rows are computed over a DIFFERENT predicate than the frame it carries
 * — the project reports depth, where naming is decided by the viewer's whole
 * PEOPLE scope while the link carries one `?src=` frame — must pass the
 * SERVER-RESOLVED value. Assuming `true` there produced the exact defect this
 * module exists to prevent: a contributor named through CC-B, linked with
 * `src=cc:A`, whose destination correctly 403s.
 *
 * `isActive` and `isProvisional` cannot be inferred and must be carried on the
 * row: a deactivated subject and an unconfirmed shadow identity both 403 at the
 * endpoint, so linking either is a live-looking dead button.
 *
 * BOTH ARE REQUIRED — `isProvisional` USED to default to `false`, justified as
 * "every manager-facing figure these surfaces render already excludes
 * provisional rows". That justification was false on three surfaces at once
 * (r5-H1: the regional signals strip, the cost-centre soft-cap card, the finance
 * overage drivers), and the default is what made the omission SILENT: a producer
 * that forgot the fact still compiled, and the missing fact ADMITTED the drill.
 * A security conjunct with a permissive default is a conjunct a new call site
 * can forget, so this signature no longer lets it. The server-side facts come
 * from `server/reporting/teammate-drill-facts.ts`, and
 * `tests/unit/server/teammate-drill-facts-contract.test.ts` enumerates every
