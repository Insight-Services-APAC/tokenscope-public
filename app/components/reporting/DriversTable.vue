/*
 * DriversTable — the ranked driver breakdown with a visible sum-back check.
 *
 * build-design §3/§5 + owner-decisions D-Q6:
 *  - `update:axis` re-pivots the breakdown (practice / teammate / model / …).
 *  - `drill` fires when a row is activated (accessible <button> per row).
 *  - A sum-back CHECK ROW compares Σ(rows) to `headlineUsd` and goes RED on any
 *    mismatch — drivers must reconcile to the headline in the same lane.
 *  - ANY `spendClass:'pooled-usage'` row FORCES the footer
 *    "per-seat share is informational — billing is pooled" (Copilot per-seat
 *    share is never a charge). `pooled-usage` and `estimated` rows render muted
 *    so they never read like a hard dollar — this is also the Overage-Drivers
 *    presentation (a proportional INDICATIVE share, never a charge; D-Q6
 *    layer 3). `indicative` is NOT muted per row; see "one caveat, once" below.
 *    `billed` rows are the EXCEPTION and render as a hard dollar, because they
 *    ARE one: the provider's own money off the billed lane
 *    (`provider_usage_fact`). Muting them would state the opposite of the truth.
 *  - BILLED LANE (`billedLane` prop): a billed axis answers a narrower question
 *    than the attributed axes beside it, so the table says how complete that lane
 *    is instead of letting a smaller headline pass unexplained, and an empty
 *    billed lane reads as "not derived yet" rather than "$0 spent". Its
 *    CONSUMPTION arms (Copilot) render in their OWN block, below the billed
 *    total and never inside it — `provider_usage_fact.cost_usd` is billed money
 *    on an Anthropic row and gross credits on a GitHub one (mig 0120), and the
 *    one thing this table must never do is add them.
 *  - SURFACE MIX (requirement 3): when a row carries `surfaceBreakdown` (the
 *    teammate axis today), an extra column renders a per-lane stacked
 *    indicator — same visual pattern as FinanceCouTable's "Surface mix"
 *    column: FIXED per-lane colours (`vendorLaneColor` — never invented),
 *    per-segment tooltips, and the page's usual `LaneLegend` above the table
 *    (identity is never colour-alone). A row without a breakdown (e.g. the
 *    project axis's folded "(all other — N projects)" tail) renders a muted
 *    placeholder. Segment
 *    Σ === the row's own Spend column exactly (server-guaranteed sum-back).
 *  - USAGE PROVENANCE (requirement 4): a row carrying `provenanceBreakdown`
 *    gets a native tooltip on its driver label naming its otel-emitted /
 *    api-reconciled / provider-usage mix — a "blended row" (e.g. a teammate
 *    with both OTel Claude Code AND ingest-only Claude Chat usage) states the
 *    split rather than silently averaging it away.
 *  - AGAINST BUDGET (04-prototype-delta.md §5b): a row carrying `budgetUsd`
 *    renders CONSUMPTION — "87% of $6,024" — instead of a bare share. A project
 *    owner cannot act on "3% of the company", and that figure only shrinks as
 *    the estate grows; consumption against their own budget is the question they
 *    hold. THREE states: a number is an allocation to consume; `budgetUsd: null`
 *    renders "no budget set" (a missing decision, never 0%); the field being
 *    ABSENT renders as not-applicable, because that row has nothing a budget
 *    could be set on (the untagged bucket, the folded multi-project remainder).
 *  - THE SECOND OPERAND (F5 D25): a row carrying `scopeShareUsd` states how
 *    much of its own total the READING SCOPE carries, as a sub-line under the
 *    value. The cost-centre project axis is the case: `usd` is the project's
 *    total across every centre whose people worked on it — the right operand
 *    against its budget, and the wrong one for "what did MY centre spend". Both
 *    questions are legitimate, so the row answers both instead of the axis
 *    picking one (03-snag-plan §8c). ABSENT means the two are the same number
 *    by construction; this component never synthesises one.
 *  - MODEL TIER (04-prototype-delta.md §5): a row carrying `tierBreakdown`
 *    renders a per-band stacked indicator — the SAME visual pattern as the
 *    surface mix above, with fixed per-band colours (`modelTierColor`). The
 *    BANDING is `fetchTierExposure`'s, never this component's; absence of the
 *    field means "not available", never "no frontier usage", so the column is
 *    absent entirely rather than rendering an empty bar.
 *
 * ── EVERY COLUMN IS NAMED (prototype `note('fix 4', …)`) ─────────────────────
 * "Two bars on one row read as two data series unless the columns are named.
 * They were not, and the second one was unreadable." So the header row names all
 * of them: the AXIS's own word (never a generic "Driver" when the table knows
 * which axis it is showing), each mix column, `share of spend` over the
 * magnitude bar, the caller's word for the value column, and one right-hand
 * column — `Against budget` where the rows carry one, `%` otherwise.
 *
 * The magnitude bar lives IN the row, scaled against the LARGEST row rather than
 * the headline, so a small row is still visible. Its ARIA label states the row's
 * true share of the denominator rather than its bar width — the scaling is a
 * legibility choice, and announcing it would be announcing the wrong number.
 *
 * A caller that renders it is a caller that no longer needs a separate ranked
 * chart above the table; the whole-company Top-drivers card dropped one on that
 * basis (two renderings of one ranking is the divergence `note('fix 4a', …)` is
 * about, one card smaller). Whether any OTHER caller still has one is that
 * caller's business, not a claim this component may make.
 *
 * ── ONE CAVEAT, ONCE (prototype `note('fix 4', …)`) ─────────────────────────
 * "If a figure needs a caveat on every row, the caveat belongs in the card,
 * once." `indicative` was on every row of every attributed table, so it is now a
 * single statement above the table and carries no per-row badge and no muting.
 * `pooled-usage` and `estimated` KEEP theirs: those appear BESIDE rows of a
 * different class in one table, so the marking is per-row information rather
 * than a repeated card-level fact.
 *
 * NO SELECTOR IS ALSO A SHAPE: `axisOptions` may be empty, and then no pivot
 * control renders. The cost-centre heroes use that — their owner has exactly two
 * questions and sees both at once instead of toggling.

              2026-08-10, having just corrected the homing themselves.

              IT DOES NOT PROMISE A MIGRATE. An earlier draft said "an admin can

              total deliberately includes reconciliation-arm rows that carry a
              NULL cost-owning unit, which Migrate does not touch. A project made
              only of those would have been told a fix exists that previews zero
              rows — the same over-claiming this whole page is about. So it
              states the FACT and points at where the answer lives.
