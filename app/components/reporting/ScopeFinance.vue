 * ScopeFinance — the DATA CONTAINER + persistent header for the FINANCE (§B

 * (`/reports/finance{,/[couId]}`), the URL state (via useReportState), and the
 * header (title + DateRangeControl + the ONE consolidated settling chip), then hands
 * the pure body props to ScopeFinanceView. Keeping the header here (not in the view)
 * is deliberate: the view stays bare-mountable / unit-testable, while the header —
 * which self-wires the useReportState-bound DateRangeControl — lives where the router
 * is always present.
 *
 * WINDOW: a custom `[from, to]` range wins when the DateRangeControl set one; else
 * Finance DEFAULTS to the LAST COMPLETE month (you cannot charge back a month in
 * progress). The bill/chargeback surfaces are month-grained, so a custom range picks
 * up the whole `period_month`s it spans (server side). The per-CoU DRILL windows on the
 * SAME period as the index (the full range in quarter mode), so the drill's Chargeable
 * foots to the index's per-CoU total — never to just the range's first month.
 *
 * The CoU drill reuses the shared `cc` URL key (a CoU IS a cost-owning unit); a tab
 * switch already clears `cc`, so no stale drill survives a scope change.

 * fetches "hold rather than requesting a month nobody resolved". They did not:
 * `useFetch` fired immediately with an EMPTY query, so the first paint of a cold
 * `/reporting?scope=finance` asked the server to pick its own window — which is
 * a second clock, the exact thing F1/D3 removes — and then replaced it a moment
 * later once the real month arrived. Two windows, one screen, and the header
 * label belonged to only one of them.
 *
 * `immediate: false` plus the guard below is what honours the claim. Once the
 * window resolves, `useFetch`'s own watch on the reactive `query` keeps every
 * later change refetching exactly as before.
