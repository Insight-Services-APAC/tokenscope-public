/*
 * ScopeAcrossRegionsView — the whole-of-company FinOps dashboard (build-design §3).
 *
 * PURE + prop-driven (the fetches + URL state live in the ScopeAcrossRegions
 * container), so every render state is unit-testable without a Nuxt runtime.
 * Answers "what is the company on track to spend this period, and who/what is
 * driving it" with the branded chart kit — never hand SVG:
 *
 *   header (title + region selector + lane toggle + DateRangeControl, and ONE
 *   notes disclosure carrying every caveat — ReportHeaderNotes)
 *     → BAND 1 · the selected period (month-to-date or the custom range)
 *         hero (the period's ACTUAL figure + four KPI tiles, each with its own
 *         delta) + budget coverage (a four-part bar, not prose)
 *         → Regions (table: people · usage · share, click-to-drill) — the ONLY
 *           place this page answers "which region" (`note('fix 4a', …)`)
 *         → top drivers (pivot chips, region NOT among them) + top models
 *         → concentration (how few people the spend sits with)
 *     → BAND 2 · the rolling window
 *         active developers → spend trend (7-day mean, dashed run-rate tail)
 *         → spend per active developer → where the AI spend goes
 *         → behavioural exposure
 *
 * THE PERIOD BAND HAS NO HEADER. Its hero already opens with the whole sentence
 * ("August 2026 · $5,741.89 · attributed usage · the whole company · month to
 * date · day 3 of 31"), so a band header above it stated the same window a
 * second time, one line earlier, without the figure. The ROLLING band keeps its
 * header — "does not sum into August" is a fact no card inside it carries.
 *
 * CONCENTRATION IS IN BAND 1, not band 2 where the prototype draws it, because
 * `drivers.concentration` is fetched on the PERIOD window. The prototype's bands
 * are visual; ours are a contract (see below), and its percentiles have to agree
 * with the period-windowed Median-per-person tile.
 *
 * TWO BANDS, BECAUSE THERE ARE TWO WINDOWS. The KPI figures answer over the
 * selected PERIOD; the trend/behaviour cards answer over a DECOUPLED
 * rolling window (the container's `trendWindowQuery`). The page used to interleave
 * them with nothing but per-card captions to tell them apart, so a $409 60-day
 * donut sat under a $12,855 month-to-date headline and read as an error. Each
 * window is now stated once, on a band header, and every card is inside the band
 * whose window it was fetched over — which is also what lets the cards' own
 * captions go back to naming one thing.
 *
 * The ORDER changed for that: the period cards are contiguous above the rolling
 * ones rather than split around them. A band whose members are not adjacent is
 * not a band.
 *
 * Body renders exactly ONE of skeleton / error / empty / data; the header (with
 * the date control) persists across states so the range stays adjustable while a
 * fetch is in flight. Every figure is PROVISIONAL — the settling clock says so.

 * half of the same question (what does a typical person spend, and how lopsided
 * is it). That part stands.
 *
 * The CARD was over-deleted with them. A percentile is not a population: "63% of
 * spend" never says how many humans that is, and the prototype still draws the
 * card — the sentence, the four-cohort bar and the per-cohort counts — because
 * "is this a conversation with three people or three hundred?" is the one
 * question the tile cannot answer. It is back, as ConcentrationCohortCard, off
 * `drivers.concentration` (which never stopped riding the drivers response).
 *
 * It shares the tile's arithmetic rather than restating it: the cohorts are cut
 * server-side at the same indices as top1/top10, so the two can only ever
 * publish one distribution. An earlier draft that re-derived them disagreed with
 * the tile by seven points.
 *
 * The `?report=concentration` CSV export is unaffected: it runs its own
 * `fetchConcentration`, not this field.
 *
 * STILL MISSING, and deliberately not faked: the prototype's model-tier
 * cross-tab per cohort ("what the heavy decile does differently"). It needs a
 * server measure joining cohorts to `model_catalog.tier`, which does not exist.
 * It is NOT approximated from TierExposureCard — that card's denominator is
 * billed spend over the rolling window, a different lane and a different period.

               card above it. A visual that needs another visual to be read is not
               carrying its own space (prototype: the donut is deleted there too). -->

               in chargeback mode"), so it went with the card it mirrors — see
               the note below. Deleting the §A one and keeping its §B twin would
               have left the same standing card behind a lane toggle. -->

          "WHEN SPEND HAPPENS" IS DELETED, both lenses. The prototype drops it by
          name: "Dropped for real: the Spend by surface donut … and When spend
          happens (day-of-week seasonality is interesting once, not every week)."

          The reason is about STANDING COST, not correctness. The heatmap was
          right; it just answered a question that does not change week to week,
          so it charged rent on every page load for an insight the reader already
          had. The surface donut went earlier for the same class of reason.

          Its §B twin (ChargebackDowCard) went with it, above.

          Behavioural exposure is therefore the last card in this band, which is
          also where the prototype ends.
