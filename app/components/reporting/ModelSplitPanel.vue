/*
 * ModelSplitPanel — the body of BOTH Top-models cards (region and whole-company).
 *
 * docs/design/reporting-consolidation/07-model-axis-subtraction-build.md D6
 * (owner ruling 2026-08-04): the Top models card RANKS MODELS ONLY, and
 * non-model money is a one-line coverage FOOTER, not a category row and not a
 * labelled group band.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS REPLACES ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The previous shape kept the NULL-model rows out of the ranking (right) but
 * rendered them as two labelled group bands under it ('structural' /
 * 'not-carried', each with its own rows, dollars and shares). After mig 0124
 * the view fans those buckets out into NAMED models plus small reason-typed
 * remainders — so the bands would price crumbs under two headings and a badge.
 * The acceptance gate says neither "Not split by model" nor "Model not
 * captured for this surface" appears AS A CATEGORY ROW; the remainder money
 * moves to the footer, priced, with its reason's wording.
 *
 * ── THE CLASSIFICATION IS THE SHARED MODULE'S, AND IT IS DEFAULT-SAFE ────────
 *
 * `modelBucketKind` (shared/reports/model-attribution.ts) answers 'model' |
 * 'remainder' from the key alone; the footer WORDING keys off each row's
 * `gap_reason`. Any NULL-model row with an unrecognised or absent reason folds
 * into the generic remainder segment — a new reason value can never re-open a
 * category row here (D6, tests 20/21). The billed lane's BILLED_NO_MODEL_KEY
 * row carries no reason and gets the same generic-segment treatment.
 *
 * ── EVERY FIGURE HERE IS ONE LANE'S (prototype note `lane`) ──────────────────
 *
 * `denominatorUsd` is the RESPONSE's own `headlineUsd` for this axis, in the
 * lane the response declares. The bars and the footer's percentage divide by
 * that one number, so the panel cannot mix a numerator from one lane with a
 * denominator from the other. Sum-back is SERVER-SIDE and untouched: the
 * endpoint still returns the remainder rows; this panel renders them as the
 * footer instead of as categories.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE SUBTRACTS ONE LANE FROM THE OTHER. "Attributed minus billed" is
 * not the self-billed amount — the billed-lane note below states that the two
 * totals legitimately differ rather than naming a difference we cannot
 * decompose.
