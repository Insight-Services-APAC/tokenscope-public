/*
 * ScopeRegional — the DATA CONTAINER for the Region scope's SINGLE-REGION width
 * (build-design §3; 04-prototype-delta.md §6), rebuilt on the reporting chart kit.
 *
 * It is no longer a scope of its own: `ScopeRegion` mounts it whenever the region
 * selector is on a region rather than "All regions". Its requests carry that region
 * (or none, meaning the caller's server-resolved default), which is what routes the
 * endpoint to `clampedUsage` rather than the whole-company answer.
 *
 * Owns every fetch and reads the URL state via useReportState (the sole owner of
 * month + region + ou + the custom `from`/`to` range), then hands everything to
 * the pure ScopeRegionalView tree.
 *
 * WINDOW: all fetches honour the active window — a custom `[from, to]` range when
 * the DateRangeControl set one, else `month` (else the server's current-month
 * default). Forecast/MoM come back null for a custom range; the View hides them.
 *
 * DRIVERS: three cuts so each card is stable and self-contained —
 *   - `drivers`         : the switchable DriversTable (axis = table state). On the
 *     teammate axis it READS `teammateDrivers` rather than requesting the same URL
 *     a second time under its own key, and it renders a response only while that
 *     response's OWN `axis` and `region` are the ones on screen (teammate-cut.ts).
 *   - `modelDrivers`    : Top-models ranked bar (axis=model)
 *   - `teammateDrivers` : Concentration (axis=teammate) — computed client-side,
 *     through the same on-screen test
 *
 * TREND: the trend request carries its own `region` (no axis), so it goes through the
 * REGION half of that test too (`trendOnScreen`) — one guard for every trend-derived
 * surface. `active-trend` returns no region and is NOT covered —
 * see teammate-cut.ts.
 *
 * BEHAVIOUR: `/reports/region/behaviour` reflects back BOTH the width it answered
 * at and the region it answered for, so it takes the same test
 * (`behaviourOnScreen`). Its pending and error refs are read like every other
 * request's — a request whose three refs are discarded is a request that reports a
 * half-loaded screen as settled and a failed one as an answer.
 *
 * DEFAULT REGION: resolved SERVER-SIDE (resolveRegionalScope) and reflected back
 * as `report.region`. This container does not second-guess it. It used to: it
 * waited for the first response, ranked the regions by spend with an extra
 * across-regions request, then patched the URL — which recomputed every query
 * object and re-issued all seven fetches, so the whole first round was discarded
 * and the user watched one region's figures flip to another's.
 *
 * MoM: the endpoint returns it (`kpis.momDeltaPct`, engine/kpis.ts), day-paced
 * under the same clamp as the total. The client-side prior-month fetch that used
 * to stand in for it is gone.
