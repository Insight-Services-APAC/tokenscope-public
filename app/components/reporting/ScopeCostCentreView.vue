 * ScopeCostCentreView — the Cost-Centre reporting scope, rebuilt as a ranked
 * BUDGET TRACKER (reporting-redesign wave B). Answers "which cost-centres are
 * burning fastest, and which are at budget risk?" — replacing the old card-wall
 * of near-identical "$X of no allocation / on track within budget" tiles.
 *
 * PURE + prop-driven (fetches + URL state live in the ScopeCostCentre container),
 * so every render state is unit-testable without a Nuxt runtime. Matches the
 * Across flagship's design language: a persistent header (title + ONE settling
 * chip + DateRangeControl), hairline KPI tiles, section cards, the branded chart
 * kit (never hand SVG), and the fixed provider palette (Claude = magenta, Copilot
 * = blue — never purple).
 *
 * The body renders exactly ONE of skeleton / error / empty / data — independently
 * for the GRID (no `cc`) and the DRILL (`cc` set). The header (with the date
 * control) persists across states so the range stays adjustable mid-fetch.
 *
 * THE §A SPINE, and a §B lane beside it. The tracker's card burn and the drill
 * both read the project-CoU USAGE axis (`v_complete_usage WHERE cost_owning_unit_id`),
 * so drilling a row shows WHO/WHAT is burning that budget and reconciles to the
 * tracker figure. The CHARGEBACK lane re-lenses the headline to §B and adds
 * Behavioural exposure; the two are never summed (contract C2). The invoice-grade
 * chargeback REPORT still lives only in the Finance tab.
 *
 * TWO BANDS, TWO WINDOWS. Band 1 is the month (hero + four tiles + coverage);
 * band 2 is a ~60-day rolling frame ending at the SETTLED edge, fetched
 * separately and rendering its own states. They do not sum into each other and
 * each says so.

 *  - The BUDGETS hero can carry rows the burn axis cannot: arm-2 money has a real
 *    `project_id` with a NULL `cost_owning_unit_id`, so a centre with budget rows and
 *    no burn still has something to show.

 *
 * The first fix SUPPRESSED the empty state whenever the band had money. An

 * render a full zero-valued drill instead of saying so. Both readings are then

 * The owner of a BU hit that sentence while looking at the BU they own, having
 * spent $4,666.97 that month. Both halves failed at once:
 *
 *   · THE FACT was about placement, not about them. They were homed on the
 *     REGION DEFAULT BU — the dumping ground admin flags as "N of M do not
 *     belong here" — so the roster was genuinely empty while the person reading
 *     the page was, in every sense that matters, in the BU.
 *   · THE CAUSATION was false regardless. Burn is project-homed: a BU with a
 *     zero roster still has usage if a tagged project homes to it, and a fully
 *     staffed BU shows nothing if its people's projects home elsewhere. Roster
 *     size does not cause the total. (`00-epic-design.md` S1 says exactly this;
 *     it was written two days before this shipped and I did not read it.)
 *
 * So the rule now: STATE WHAT WAS MEASURED, OFFER THE ROUTES, ASSERT NO CAUSE.
 * `rosterCount` still distinguishes the two empties, because they lead to
 * genuinely different next actions — but it is reported as an observation
 * ("no-one is homed here") beside the other, never as the reason for it.
 * Correct under BOTH homing modes (OD1), which is the AC S1 sets.

             cannot change anything teaches readers to ignore controls"*
             (prototype note `fix 6`), and re-labelling §A content with a §B word
             is the lane conflation `Reporting.md` §1 forbids. HIDDEN rather than
             disabled, with the lane stated as a fact instead, because a disabled
             control still claims the figures have two lanes.

             THE PILL NAMES THE BURN, NOT THE WHOLE PAGE (external review).
             It used to read "This drill has no billed lane", which the page
             contradicts one card lower: `TierExposureCard` renders §B
             (`provider_usage_fact`, banded by model tier) under its own "Billed
             spend" headings. That card is not a lane the toggle switches — it is
             a SEPARATE, self-labelled §B answer that consistency contract C2
             forbids summing with the burn — so the fix is the claim, not the
             card. `Reporting.md` §1 forbids MIXING the lanes; it does not forbid
             a page carrying both where each says which it is. -->
        <!--
          THE TOGGLE IS BACK AT COST-CENTRE SCOPE (reverses D24, owner 2026-08-06).
          It was replaced with a static "§A · usage lane" pill on the argument
          that the drill is usage-only "by construction" and switching lanes
          "would change nothing here". Both halves were wrong:

            - The drawing has it. `controls(d)` renders BOTH lanes and is called
              UNCONDITIONALLY (`R:561`), before any scope branch; the Region tab
              ships it today. D24 justified removal by quoting the `scope` note
              "a cost-centre owner does not pivot" (`R:772`) — which is about the
              PIVOT control, not the LANE control. One sentence, two controls.
            - Switching DOES change something: every card already carries
              `chargeUsd`, the §B figure for that centre. Removing the control
              left the figure orphaned, not absent.

          A cost-centre owner is accountable for a budget: "am I on track" is
          answered by what the centre is CHARGED, "what is driving it" by what
          their people CONSUMED. Denying either half does not simplify the page,
          it makes half the job impossible on it.

        put on this page. They sit in the unconditional tail of the prototype's
        `across()`, which `cc(d)` runs, so they were never cost-centre-specific
        code anyone could find by searching for `SK==='cc'` — which is exactly
        why they went unbuilt while the three cards inside those blocks did not.
        `docs/design/reporting-consolidation/inventory.json` records them;
        `tests/unit/reporting/prototype-parity.test.ts` now asserts them.

        ScopeHero is the SAME component both Region widths render, reading the
        same structural contract, so a third KPI row cannot drift from the other
        two — the drift that produced two disagreeing Region heroes before they
        were merged onto it.

        BAND 2 · the rolling window. Four surfaces the approved prototype has
        always drawn on this page and none of which were built — they sit in the
        unconditional tail of the prototype's `across()`, so no search for
        cost-centre code ever reached them.

        ITS WINDOW IS NOT THE MONTH ABOVE IT. ~60 days to the SETTLED edge, from
        the same `rollingTrendWindow` the Region scope uses. `ReportBand` prints
        the window and the "does not sum into" note, so the two frames can never
        be mistaken for each other — and the run-rate stays on the month tile
        above rather than hanging off a rolling frame.

        THE BASIS SAYS "THROUGH THE LAST SETTLED DAY", NOT "ends today". An
        earlier draft copied the Region band's wording, which is wrong for both:
        `rollingTrendWindow` ends at `clock.settledThrough` and its own header
        says "Not at `clock.today`". A caption that claims a still-filling edge
        over settled data is the overstatement this scope's whole parity effort
        exists to stop.

        IT SITS OUTSIDE THE MONTH DRILL'S BRANCH, and that is the point. Nested
        inside `drillData && drill` it was hidden whenever the MONTH came back
        empty — so a centre with no current-month usage but sixty days of history
        showed the month's empty state and silently dropped a rolling band that
        had loaded successfully. The two fetches answer different windows and
        fail independently, so each renders its own states: a dead trend must not
        blank a healthy month, and an empty month must not hide a healthy trend.
