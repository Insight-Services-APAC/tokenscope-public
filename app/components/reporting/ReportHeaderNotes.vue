/*
 * ReportHeaderNotes — ONE chip holding every caveat that used to stack above the
 * first number on a /reporting scope.
 *
 * WHAT IT REPLACES. The Region header printed, in order: three settling chips
 * (Anthropic / GitHub Copilot / Usage, each reading "Estimated · month in
 * progress" — one fact, said three times), a coverage marker with its
 * descriptor, "Usage dimensions as at emit (point-in-time)", and the lane
 * explainer. Six lines of commentary before the reader reached the figure they
 * came for.
 *
 * THEN IT REPLACED ITSELF. The first pass collapsed those six lines into a
 * disclosure, but left THREE elements in the header: a settling chip, a coverage
 * chip and a "What these figures are" link. Three affordances where one will do
 * is the same disease in smaller type — a wall of chips telling the reader three
 * times that a figure is provisional. There is now exactly ONE chip: it STATES
 * the weakest current state and it IS the control that opens the detail.
 *
 * NOTHING IS DELETED — IT IS RELOCATED. Every sentence below is the same string
 * its original component rendered, produced by the same component
 * (SettlingStateChip / CoverageMarker) from the same server fields. A finance
 * reader still needs all of it; they do not need it before the headline. If you
 * are tempted to reword something while it is in here, don't: the caveats were
 * argued for where they were written.
 *
 * A PAGE WITH NOTHING TO CAVEAT SAYS NOTHING. The chip renders only when there is
 * a real caveat — a settling clock, or coverage the server could not claim. The
 * lane explainer and the point-in-time note are CONTEXT, not caveats: they ride
 * inside the panel when it opens but they never summon the chip on their own,
 * because an amber chip over a page with nothing provisional on it is exactly the
 * over-statement this component exists to remove.
 *
 * `<details>`/`<summary>` rather than a bespoke popover: it is keyboard-reachable
 * and toggleable natively, its open state is exposed to assistive tech without
 * ARIA of our own, and its content is real text in the accessibility tree —
 * never a `title=` tooltip, which a screen reader and a touch device both lose.
