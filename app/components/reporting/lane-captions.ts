 * the control. They now render inside the reporting header's notes disclosure
 * instead (ReportHeaderNotes) — the control stays above the fold, the paragraph
 * explaining it does not. Two components therefore need the same two strings,
 * and a caption copied into the second one is a caption that will eventually
 * contradict the first.
 *
 * These are the EXACT sentences that were rendered before the move. Do not
 * reword them here to suit the new position: the caveats were relocated, not
 * rewritten, and each one was argued for where it was written.
