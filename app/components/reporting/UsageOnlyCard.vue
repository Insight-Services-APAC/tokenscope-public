 * UsageOnlyCard — the DELIBERATE "usage-only" placeholder shown in CHARGEBACK mode
 * wherever a card is inherently §A (daily trend, seasonality, provider/model split,
 * drivers, concentration): metrics that have NO §B analogue (the bill lane is
 * month-grained, has no tokens / models / per-day / per-user grain). Rather than
 * DROP the card (which would shift the layout), we swap it for this quiet, muted
 * placeholder so the page stays stable and the emptiness reads as INTENTIONAL, not
 * broken — a subtle diagonal hatch + carbon-3 ink + a "switch to Usage" line.
 *
 * A consistent treatment across every §A-only surface (the §A/§B re-lens contract).
