 * THE ONBOARDING SIGNAL IS "HAS THIS PERSON EVER EMITTED OTel", AND NOTHING ELSE
 * (external review r2 + owner ruling).
 *
 * Two wrong answers have now been tried here:
 *
 *  1. A standalone `/me/activity?limit=1` probe — a second independent read of
 *     the list rendered 900 lines below, which could disagree with it.
 *  2. The ActivityCard's own `hasRows`, published upward to retire that probe.
 *     But `hasRows` means "the CURRENT page of the CURRENT filter returned
 *     rows": an active filter matching nothing, or a failed refresh, reads as
 *     "never emitted" and shows a new-user CTA to an established developer.
 *
 * Both also answered the wrong QUESTION. F4 made Activity a deliberate UNION of
 * OTel sessions and API-reported provider days, so a Copilot-only teammate — who
 * has never emitted and is exactly who this CTA is for — fills the list and
 * counts as onboarded. That is the rollout gap ("people who SPENT versus people
 * EMITTING through TokenScope") mis-read as coverage.
 *
 * So the signal is a server fact on the OTel lane alone (`attribution_record`,
 * whose only writer is the Azure-Monitor reader), all-time and unfiltered, and
 * it rides the AWAITED `/me/home` payload — no second read to disagree with, and
 * a failed fetch leaves the field UNSET rather than false, so an error can never
 * present as emptiness. `=== false` is the only value that shows the CTA.
 *
 * THREE STATES, NOT TWO (owner ruling 2026-08-06 — "name the gap explicitly").
 * `has_ever_emitted` is the OTel lane alone, so it splits the CTA population in
 * a way "has any activity" cannot:
 *
 *   never emitted, NO records anywhere  → a genuinely new teammate.
 *   never emitted, but PROVIDER-API records exist → they are spending, we can
 *     see it through the provider's own API, and they are invisible to us as an
 *     emitter. Telling this person "no usage yet" is false to their face, and
 *     silently treating them as established is worse: they are exactly the
 *     rollout gap the product exists to measure — "people who SPENT versus
 *     people EMITTING through TokenScope … the one figure that measures us
 *     rather than them" (reporting prototype).
 *   emitting → no CTA.
 *
 * The middle state is detected from the awaited `usage` payload rather than a
 * second read: attributed spend with no emission is precisely provider-reported
 * money. A missing payload leaves it false, so a failed fetch never invents the
 * claim that we can see their usage.
