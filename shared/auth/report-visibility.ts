/*
 * report-visibility — the ONE source of truth for report-ACCESS vocabulary: a
 * role-derived BASELINE, widened by per-teammate positive GRANTS and zeroed by a
 * per-teammate DENY (`report_access_grant`, migs 0129 + 0130).
 * Replaces the three-mode admin dial (task #19, mig 0087,
 * `REPORT_VISIBILITY_MODES`/`reportGrants`) — that dial could only say "every
 * region admin" or "every cost-centre owner", org-wide; this says "this
 * teammate, this permission, until <expiry>".
 *
 * Two positive PERMISSIONS ({@link REPORT_ACCESS_PERMISSIONS}) an admin grants
 * per-teammate: 'operational' (every region + every Business Unit) and
 * 'finance' (the whole-company finance pack); plus ONE deny,
 * {@link REPORT_ACCESS_REVOKE} (mig 0130). {@link baselineGrants} is what every
 * caller holds with NO row at all — role + cost-centre ownership; the ORG-WIDE
 * roles (global-finops / platform-admin) hold the whole company there, every
 * other role is region-bound.
 * {@link effectiveReportGrants} widens the baseline by whichever positive
 * permissions the caller's ACTIVE grants
 * (`server/auth/report-scope.ts::resolveReportPermissions`) return — a widening
 * that applies to ANY role whose baseline lacks that scope, a region `admin`
 * included — and zeroes it outright when an active revoke is present
 * (`resolveReportAccessRevoked`). `ReportScopeGrants` (the resolved per-scope object every reporting
 * endpoint reads) keeps its SHAPE exactly as before — only what PRODUCES it
 * changed — so `server/auth/report-scope.ts` and the `/reports/**` read path
 * are untouched below the two producer functions.
 *
 * READ-ONLY blast radius by construction, unchanged from the retired policy:
 * this module is consumed only by the reporting read path
 * (server/auth/report-scope.ts and the endpoints under server/api/v1/reports/**),
 * the read-only diagnostics probe (admin/diagnostics/ab-decomposition.get.ts
 * and its panel), and the client drill contract. It never touches write
 * endpoints, provisioning, or the GUC/RLS layer.
 *
 * The regional / cost-centre grants stay AUTHORIZATION LEVELS, never region-clamp
 * bypasses: `'own-region'` still routes through the existing region clamp
 * (resolveRegionalScope); only `'all-regions'` widens. `finance` is a simple BOOLEAN —
 * the whole-company `/reports/finance` pack is the only consumer, and it is
 * region-unbounded by design (global finance is a global function), so there is no
 * region-clamp level to express. The static {@link WHO_SEES_WHAT_BASELINE} /
 * {@link WHO_SEES_WHAT_ELEVATED} tables are the SAME shape the admin pane can render
 * and the unit tests pin the two producer functions against — so preview and
 * enforcement can never drift.

 * an `'owned-or-subtree'` floor on these roles WOULD have leaked every BU
 * through that predicate. `'all'` never touches the predicate — it routes
 * through `costCentreScopeOpts`'s `unbounded` arm, the resolvers' explicit
 * "every BU" path. So the hazard #251 named is designed out, not re-opened.
 *
 * Pulling a specific org-wide admin BELOW this default is an explicit admin
 * action and it IS expressible: an active `report_access_grant` row carrying
 * {@link REPORT_ACCESS_REVOKE} (mig 0130) zeroes their report access.
 * DENY-WINS — {@link effectiveReportGrants} returns {@link REVOKED_GRANTS}

/*
 * ── THE DRILL CONTRACT'S TWO RULES (developer pages build D38) ───────────────
 *
 * NAMING A ROW AND OPENING A DRILL ARE DIFFERENT QUESTIONS. Conflating them was
 * a round-1 HIGH on the build design (r1-H4) because the conflation is a
 * membership bypass in one direction and a dead link in the other: a project
 * MEMBER may see their team-mates NAMED on the project page and hold no reports
 * grant at all, so "named ⇒ drillable" would hand a per-person governance view
 * to anyone who joins a project. The prototype pins that persona at 403
 * (`prototype.html:780-785`).
 *
 * So there are two exported rules and they are never one:
 *   1. {@link namedContributionRow} — may this subject be NAMED in a row, or
 *      must they fold into the aggregate remainder (annex :521-526, C3)?
 *   2. {@link teammateDrillAdmission} — may this viewer OPEN this subject's
 *      reports-depth page (D34's emit-time conjunction, ALWAYS)?
 *
 * A name can be NAMED by rule 1 and PLAIN TEXT by rule 2. That is the drill
 * contract working, not a bug: a named row is not automatically a door.
 *
 * BOTH ARE PURE. They take RESOLVED FACTS, never a database handle, because the
 * SAME rule has to run in two places — the server (facts from SQL) and the
 * client (facts from the payload it was served). A second, client-side copy of
 * either rule is precisely the "second, unproven RBAC path" the annex warns
 * about (:557-561).
 */

 *
 * `Pick<…, 'teammate'>` and not the whole grant object, deliberately: these
