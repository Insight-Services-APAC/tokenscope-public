/*
 * Roles + demo personas — pilot-shaped.

 * Six canonical roles per the design / chrome.jsx RoleMenu (see ROLES below:
 * developer, manager, admin, finance, global-finops, platform-admin). Per
 * docs/build/mvp-lite-epic.md §Epic 3: "4 demo personas → each lands on
 * role-correct page". Two members are RETIRED and hold no capability:
 * `finance` (never minted) and `global-finops` (retired 2026-09-05) — both are
 * kept in the enum for historical rows only. See the banner above ADMIN_ROLES.
 *
 * Persona records below are the dev-mode mapping. Real Entra OIDC
 * (Epic 10) replaces dev-login but the role enum stays.

 * not selectable. A stray holder therefore lands on the developer tier —
 * least privilege, the same fail-closed shape `finance` has.
 *
 * DO NOT confuse this with the string 'global-finops' in `server/db/rls.ts`,

 * SCOPE VALUE the RLS policies compare against, which `platform-admin` itself
 * maps onto (rls.ts `rlsRoleFor`) and the worker lane runs as. It is a
 * different vocabulary that happens to share a spelling, and removing it would
 * break the worker lane and platform-admin's own data scope.
