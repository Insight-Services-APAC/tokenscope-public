/*
 * THE CLOCK — one resolution, shipped, never re-derived.
 *
 * `docs/design/clock-and-day-boundary.md` settles what a day is: **UTC,
 * everywhere**, because all three sources bill and report in UTC days
 * (Anthropic `bucket_width=1d` at `[day 00:00:00Z, next 00:00:00Z)`, Copilot
 * per `getUTCDate()`, OTel instants bucketed `AT TIME ZONE 'UTC'`). A local-day
 * product would make every one of our days straddle two provider days, so
 * `Σ(our days)` could never equal the bill.
 *
 * D3 is the rule this module exists for: **"today" is not a wall-clock fact, so
 * the browser must not compute it.** The server resolves the clock ONCE and
 * ships it; every clock-sensitive control consumes it. That is an *ownership*
 * rule, not a timezone one — most of the offenders it retires already used
 * correct UTC arithmetic (`getUTCFullYear`, `Date.UTC`), which is exactly why
 * two clocks disagreeing never read as a bug.
 *
 * THREE QUANTITIES, KEPT APART (D2 of the fix sprint). The codebase conflated
 * the last two and that conflation IS the morning dip:
 *
 *   - `now`            — an INSTANT. Renders in the viewer's local zone.
 *   - `today`          — the UTC day `now` falls in. STILL FILLING: it is drawn
 *                        partial and excluded from trend lines, trailing means
 *                        and peak labels. It is NOT the axis edge.
 *   - `settledThrough` — the last COMPLETE UTC day. THE AXIS EDGE.
 *
 * And a fourth that is deliberately NOT here: `asOfDate` (`MAX(event_date)`) is
 * a *data* fact — the last day we hold rows for. `settledThrough` is a
 * *coverage* fact. A series may legitimately run past `asOfDate` (a settled day
 * with genuinely no spend is a measured zero) and must never be padded past
 * `settledThrough` (a day we have not finished observing is not a zero — NULL
 * is not 0).
 *
 * DEFERRED, DISCLOSED (fix-sprint F1): provider lag as a *distinct* cause of a
 * short edge. `settledThrough` here is the last complete UTC day, full stop. A
 * provider whose pull is 30 h behind still shortens what the data can say, but
 * this contract does not yet narrow the edge for it — `clock-rot-audit.md` §H.1
 * records why (the freshness signal is a per-teammate, per-provider staleness
 * verdict, not a global last-covered day, and the fail-closed rule needs an
 * owner decision for the global case).
