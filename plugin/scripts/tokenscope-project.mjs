/*
 * tokenscope-project — the CLIENT-NEUTRAL per-repo project resolver + hasher.
 *
 * This module is the single SOURCE-OF-TRUTH for the four functions both clients
 * (Claude Code and Copilot CLI) must agree on so a committed `.tokenscope`
 * derives the SAME `project.code_hash` regardless of which client reads it:
 *
 *   - findTokenscopeFile(startDir) — walk up from cwd to the nearest `.tokenscope`.
 *   - parseTokenscope(filePath)    — parse the tiny YAML schema.
 *   - computeCodeHash(code)        — sha256(code) hex == the server's code_hash.
 *   - resolveRepoProjectCode({arg, cwd}) — arg or committed `.tokenscope` → code.
 *
 * It is DELIBERATELY self-contained (Node built-ins only, NO project imports) so
 * it can be vendored verbatim into copilot-plugin/scripts/ by
 * scripts/sync-copilot-plugin.mjs and gated by scripts/check-copilot-plugin-sync.mjs.
 * Drift between the two client copies = split attribution (the identical repo
 * derives different hashes on Claude vs Copilot). The Claude-coupled helpers
 * (writeRepoTag/mergeClaudeSettings/buildRepoResourceAttrs/writeTokenscopeFile)
 * stay in tag-repo.mjs — they pull on ~/.claude settings and must NOT ship here.
 *
 * YAML parser scope: we only need a flat `key: value` + a nested `project:` block
 * with three string fields. Avoiding the `yaml` npm dep keeps the plugin footprint
 * small (both plugins ship into user space).
