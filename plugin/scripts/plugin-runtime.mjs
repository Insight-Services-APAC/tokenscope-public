 *   - locating the bundled scripts dir + otel-headers-helper.sh (the real emit path)

 *   - the TokenScope state dir and the emit-failure sentinel

 *
 * One module owning the emit-path contract means a change there (stdio handling,
 * the Authorization-header check, the state-dir layout) lands in exactly one
 * place — the supportability win behind this extraction.
 *
 * NOTE: backfill.mjs deliberately keeps its OWN helper invocation: it needs the

 * drops TOKENSCOPE_STATE_DIR) or a dir they resolved themselves are already
 * safe; a caller reading ambient process.env must pass trustedStateDir().

/**
 * Invoke the REAL emit path (otel-headers-helper.sh) and classify the result
 * WITHOUT surfacing the bearer it prints. Returns { ran, status, hasAuth }:
 *   - ran:     false if the helper binary is missing (nothing executed)
 *   - status:  the helper's exit code (0 = a bearer was minted)
 *   - hasAuth: stdout parsed to a JSON object carrying an Authorization header
 * The helper itself writes/clears the emit-failure sentinel as a side effect.
 *
 * THE STATE DIR TRAVELS AS AN ARGUMENT, not in `env`. The helper stopped reading
 * `TOKENSCOPE_STATE_DIR` because Claude Code invokes it directly with a
 * repo-merged environment (see the header of otel-headers-helper.sh and the
 * capture it cites), so passing it here is what keeps THIS invocation writing
 * its token cache where the caller resolved rather than wherever the ambient
 * environment says. Defaults to `stateDir()` — the same value the helper's own
 * passwd-home fallback would compute when nothing is pinned.
 *
 * `/bin/sh`, not `sh`: the interpreter is resolved by the OS from PATH when the
 * command is a bare name, and PATH is one of the variables a repository can set
 * (same capture). An absolute path is not steerable.
 *
 * THE DEFAULT IS `trustedStateDir()`, NOT `stateDir()`. `stateDir()` honours a
 * `TOKENSCOPE_STATE_DIR` process-level pin, which is right for a deployment or
 * test sandbox — but this function MINTS A CREDENTIAL, and on the Claude lane
 * that variable is repo-settable (the settings merge; see the capture doc). The
 * callers that legitimately pin — the SessionStart hook, which has established
 * provenance — pass `stateDir` explicitly. The callers that do NOT pass one
 * (`status.mjs`, and any added later) get the passwd home rather than silently
 * inheriting whatever the ambient environment says, which is the safe default
 * for a function whose side effect is writing a token cache.
 *
 * @param {{env?: Record<string,string>, timeoutMs?: number, stateDir?: string}} [opts]
