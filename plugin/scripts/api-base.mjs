/*
 * Resolve the TokenScope API base URL (the Claude Code plugin's scripts).
 *
 * Resolution order, most-explicit first:
 *   1. explicit arg             — the caller named it outright, so nothing
 *      ambient should be able to override that. The env var used to win here,
 *      which meant a stale exported TOKENSCOPE_API_BASE silently beat a base the
 *      caller had just passed in.
 *   2. TOKENSCOPE_API_BASE env, BUT ONLY WHEN IT NAMES LOOPBACK — the documented
 *      local-dev override (http://localhost:3450). An off-box value is ignored
 *      outright: a cloned repository can supply this variable and there is no way
 *      to tell a repo-injected value from a shell-exported one.
 *   3. configured               — the plugin's `server_url` option (#415), the
 *      value Claude Code substitutes into `.mcp.json`'s
 *      `${user_config.server_url}`. Read from the managed and USER settings
 *      files only (see configuredServerUrl), never from the
 *      `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_OPTION_SERVER_URL` env var Claude Code also exports,
 *      because a repository's `env` reaches hook processes too.
 *   4. discovered               — an MCP registration the human made with
 *      `claude mcp add` (see mcp-origin.mjs).
 *   5. DEFAULT_API_BASE         — the packaged default: the same value as
 *      `server_url`'s `default` in .claude-plugin/plugin.json, so an install
 *      with no configured value talks to one server from both halves.
 *
 * DEFAULT_API_BASE is the GBS Dev environment's custom domain in the internal
 * build. The public build ships it EMPTY (tools/publish/substitutions.txt), so a
 * device with nothing configured gets a "set your TokenScope URL" error instead
 * of a placeholder host. The OTLP, bearer and emit endpoints are not baked: the
 * resolved server returns them at provision time (server/auth/emit-provision.ts).

/**
 * Resolve the API base (explicit arg > loopback env override > configured
 * `server_url` > discovered registration > packaged default), trailing slash
 * stripped, VALIDATED before it is returned (S1 fix 2/3). Throws
 * UNSET_SERVER_MESSAGE when nothing names a server (the public build).
 *
 * `configured` and `packagedDefault` are seams: production passes neither and
 * gets the settings-file read and DEFAULT_API_BASE.
 *
 * WHY THE ARG OUTRANKS EVERYTHING. This used to read env-first, on the general
 * principle that an operator's environment overrides a script default. That is
 * right when the arg IS a default, and wrong here, because the argument the
 * redeem flow passes is not a default: it is the origin of the server that
 * MINTED the one-time handoff code, returned by that server in the same
 * response. A handoff can only be redeemed at its issuer, so a stale
 * TOKENSCOPE_API_BASE outranking it does not "override a default", it sends a
 * live single-use secret to a host that cannot honour it — silently, since the
 * wrong host simply 404s.
 *
 * WHY THE ENV SOURCE IS NOW LOOPBACK-ONLY, and why there is no longer a
 * `trustEnv` flag. That flag defaulted to TRUE with `trustEnv: false` as the
 * opt-out, which made "is this safe?" mean "did we enumerate every caller?" —
 * a question answered from memory, and answered wrong. The redeem helpers were
 * hardened and both ENROL doors kept the old precedence for weeks, carrying the
 * org-wide enrollment secret outbound and the durable emit destination back.
 * By the time every caller passed `false`, the flag's only remaining value was
 * `false`, so the branch was already unreachable and deleting it is provably
 * behaviour-preserving rather than merely tidier. A parameter whose safe setting
 * has to be remembered is the defect; a required parameter would only have made
 * the remembering louder.
 *
 * What deletion alone would NOT have fixed is local Claude development, which
 * that state left broken: no env read, and no discoverable bundle either — see
 * `mcp-origin.mjs` on why the Claude bundle tier is structurally invisible to
 * discovery — so a local developer fell silently through to the baked dev host.
 * Gating on loopback restores exactly that case and expresses none of the
 * threat, because the threat is naming an off-box destination.
 *
 * Callers therefore inherit the safe behaviour with nothing to pass and nothing
 * to forget, which is the only form of this fix that a caller written next year
 * cannot undo by omission.
 *
 * Validating the RESOLVED base here, once, means every caller inherits the
 * endpoint guard rather than each needing its own.
