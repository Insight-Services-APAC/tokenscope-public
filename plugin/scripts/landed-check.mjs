 * WITHOUT making a network call itself.
 *
 * Calls GET /api/v1/instances/{id}/health (emit-credential authed — the same gate as
 * /bearer) using the emit access token the headers-helper already cached
 * (`<state>/oauth-access.<tool>.json`). Best-effort + short timeout: ANY failure leaves the
 * last-landed cache untouched, so the statusline simply renders from the last good
 * answer. Called by the session-start hook, `/tokenscope:status`, AND — throttled +
 * detached, never blocking a render — by the always-on statusline itself, so the
 * landing state stays fresh through a long session without the statusline ever making
 * a synchronous network call.
