// Scheduled worker jobs (Container Apps Jobs, Schedule trigger).
//
// Each job runs `node scripts/cron-trigger.mjs` with WORKER_NAME=<key>, which
// calls the internal /api/v1/internal/run-worker/<name> endpoint (HMAC-authed)
// on the web app. The worker keys + intended cadence are the source of truth in
// server/workers/registry.ts (recommendedCron); this module materialises the
// subset that should run on the deployed env.
//
// History: the original 6 jobs were created ad-hoc via `az` (outside IaC). This
// module captures them PLUS the two ADR-0005 observability workers
// (went-silent, reconciliation-gap), so the cron surface is finally codified.
// On a sandbox with no GitHub deploy workflow, mirror with `az containerapp job
// create` (see the deploy runbook).
//
// FIRST-APPLY WARNING — HISTORICAL, resolved 2026-06. This used to warn that a full
// apply would converge the 6 originally-ad-hoc-created jobs (cron, replicaTimeout,
// retry limit, resources, env) and overwrite any live drift. That convergence has
// since happened: infra.yml has been applied to Dev repeatedly (most recently
// 2026-07-02), so the values declared here ARE the live values, and a re-apply is
// an ordinary converging apply rather than a first-time reconciliation.
// Kept rather than deleted because the stale warning caused real over-caution when
// scheduling the workers in PR #186 — if you are weighing an apply, check the
// infra.yml run history instead of trusting a comment about the state of the world.
// infra.yml previews with `az deployment group what-if` before it applies.
//
// NOT every registered worker is scheduled on this env (intentional). Exactly ONE
// registered worker is DELIBERATELY left unscheduled here (enforced by
// tests/unit/workers/worker-schedule-lockstep.test.ts KNOWN_UNSCHEDULED):
//   - archive-ledger     — a hard no-op until LEDGER_ARCHIVE_ENABLED=true, and
//                          ENABLING is blocked on an unbuilt v_complete_usage §A
//                          cold-fallback (archival would blind §A usage reporting).
// Everything else registered IS scheduled below — the lockstep test fails CI if a
// registered worker is neither scheduled nor in the KNOWN_UNSCHEDULED list, so the
// silent-no-op trap (a worker that exists but never runs) cannot recur.
