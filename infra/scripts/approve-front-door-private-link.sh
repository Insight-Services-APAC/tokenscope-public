# Wait for a running TokenScope deployment to finish, approving Azure Front
# Door Premium's Private Link request on the Container Apps environment when it
# appears.
#
# Front Door's origin does not finish provisioning until that request is
# approved, so approval has to happen WHILE the apply runs. Start the apply with
# --no-wait, then run this:
#
#   az deployment group create -g "$RG" --template-file infra/main.bicep \
#     --parameters "$PARAMS" --no-wait
#   infra/scripts/approve-front-door-private-link.sh "$RG"
#
# Exits 0 when the deployment succeeded, non-zero (with the error) when it did
# not, and 3 when the only failure is a never-started Container App's missing
# image (MANIFEST_UNKNOWN): the expected end of a first apply, before any image
# has been pushed. Resources that depend on the app were skipped, so the next
# apply after the image exists creates them. With Private Link it then waits for the Front Door endpoint to serve the
# app, and fails if it never does. A deployment without Front Door Premium on a
# VNet just waits.
#
# Microsoft documents one Front Door private endpoint per Private Link origin
# (location, resource and group); changing any of them files another. The
# request message is not secret (the Front Door ID it hashes is a deployment
# output and often sits in a committed parameter file) and anyone can name a
# resource group eafd-*, so neither tells Front Door's request apart from one an
# outsider files against this environment. So a Pending request carrying this
# deployment's message from an eafd-* group is approved only when it is the
# only one, it was not already Pending when this script started, and no
# connection is Approved with this deployment's message (old or new). Anything
# else stops the script, listing every such connection with the command that
# approves one by hand and keeps the message, for an operator to decide. That
# narrows an outsider to a request filed during the apply, before Front Door's,
# and then the script still stops when Front Door's arrives. Re-approval touches
# only connections that are already Approved, never one an operator Rejected; it
# also accepts the message releases before 1.0.4 wrote. Uses the Container
# Apps API: the generic `az network private-endpoint-connection` commands report
# a stale status for this resource type.
