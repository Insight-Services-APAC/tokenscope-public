  # Provision the NON-OWNER app role that makes the RLS policies execute
  # (docs/design/rls-enforcement.md §9). DORMANT BY DEFAULT: a no-op unless
  # TOKENSCOPE_PROVISION_APP_ROLE=true, so shipping it changes nothing until
  # someone opts in. Runs on the OWNER's DATABASE_URL (same login as migrate.ts
  # — its ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES only covers objects created by the role that
  # runs it). Idempotent and safe on every replica restart.
  #
  # IT CREATES A ROLE. IT DOES NOT TOUCH RLS POSTURE. The cutover DISABLE sweep
  # is the NEXT step and its own script, because its trigger was wrong three
  # adversarial rounds running while it was a side effect of provisioning.
  # Creating a role and cutting an estate over to RLS enforcement are two
  # decisions with two opt-ins.
  #
  # ONE THING IT DOES EVEN WHEN DORMANT: if TOKENSCOPE_APP_DATABASE_URL is set,
  # it probes that credential. useAppRoleAtRuntime=true with
  # provisionAppRole=false is a combination Bicep permits, and it used to boot
  # silently into a permanent 503.
  #
  # THE PASSWORD IS SET ONCE, WHEN THE ROLE IS CREATED. A boot that finds the
  # role already there does NOT touch its password — not to "re-sync" it, not
  # because the Key Vault secret looks different. The app may be serving on that
  # credential right now, and this container cannot tell whether the secret it
  # was handed is newer or older than the one the role holds.
  #
  #   TOKENSCOPE_ROTATE_APP_DB_PASSWORD=true IS THE ONLY PATH THAT CHANGES AN
  #   EXISTING ROLE'S PASSWORD (Bicep: param rotateAppDbPassword).
  #
  # It is off by default and is meant to be on for ONE deliberate boot, after
  # re-applying infra.yml with writeAppDbPassword=true. Left on, every restart is
  # a rotation again — which is the behaviour this step was cut down to remove,
  # because a restart that rotates takes the credential out from under whichever
  # replica is already serving.
  #
  # EXIT CODES ARE THE CONTRACT, not the mere fact of failure:
  #   1 = the step did not finish. Non-fatal: the next boot retries. A failed run
  #       cannot have taken the runtime's credential away — an existing role's
  #       password is untouched unless rotation was explicitly requested, and a
  #       rotation is one statement inside the one transaction, so either side of
  #       the commit leaves a credential some deployment holds.
  #       A database this container could not REACH lands here too, and so does a
  #       server error that is not about identity (53300 too many connections,
  #       say): neither is evidence about the credential, and if the fault
  #       persists the revision fails its readiness probe and Container Apps
  #       keeps the previous revision anyway.
  #   3 = TOKENSCOPE_APP_DATABASE_URL names a credential that is genuinely
  #       broken: unparseable, rejected by the server's AUTHENTICATION (SQLSTATE
  #       class 28), pointed at a database that does not exist (3D000), or
  #       authenticating as somebody else. FATAL — booting would serve 500s from
  #       a deploy that reported healthy.
  #   * = ANY OTHER non-zero code is a code this contract does not define — a
  #       SIGKILL from the OOM killer or a boot timeout exits 128+N. Treated as
  #       unsafe whenever provisioning was requested, because the step may have
  #       committed and died before it could report. (It carries its own deadline
  #       so an overrun classifies itself first; reaching here means something

  # THE CUTOVER SWEEP — a distinct, deliberate, once-per-environment operation,
  # which is why it is its own script with its own opt-in and not a side effect
  # of the step above (docs/design/rls-enforcement.md §5, §7, §9 step 0).
  #
  # FORCE binds the OWNER; a NON-OWNER is bound by ENABLE alone, so the instant
  # the runtime connects as the app role EVERY RLS-enabled table starts
  # filtering — including the ones read before any identity exists, which stops
  # the emit fleet. This DISABLEs row-level security on every RLS-enabled table
  # that is not already FORCEd, then stamps seed_state so it does not re-run.
  #
  # IT NEVER DISABLES A FORCEd TABLE. That is how a rollout phase says
  # "deliberately enabled, hands off", and a boot script reverting one is the
  # defect this split exists to end. A BOOTSTRAP table that is FORCEd is a
  # genuine §5-vs-§7 conflict, and the step refuses (code 4) rather than picking
  # a winner silently.
  #
  # DORMANT BY DEFAULT and safe to leave on: a no-op unless
  # TOKENSCOPE_RLS_CUTOVER_SWEEP=true (Bicep: param runRlsCutoverSweep), and once
  # the ledger is stamped it reports the sweep it WOULD have run and changes
  # nothing. Re-sweeping means bumping RLS_CUTOVER_SWEEP_VERSION, deliberately.
  #
  # EXIT CODES:
  #   1 = the step did not finish and NOTHING WAS COMMITTED. Non-fatal, and the
  #       next boot genuinely does retry. The transaction may have started and
  #       may have run DDL; none of it survives, because every write is in one
  #       transaction and the ledger stamp is inside it.
  #   5 = the ledger MAY be stamped, so the next boot may not retry. Two states
  #       share the code because they share a recovery: the transaction
  #       COMMITTED and verification then failed, or it was IN FLIGHT when the
  #       deadline fired (a deadline can land while Postgres is completing the
  #       COMMIT, and the client is told nothing). Non-fatal. Recovery is to
  #       read the posture and bump the version, never a restart. This code
  #       exists because code 1's "the next boot retries" is FALSE for both,
  #       and a confidently wrong recovery instruction is worse than none.
  #   4 = REFUSED on a §5-vs-§7 conflict. Nothing changed, nothing stamped.
  #       Non-fatal on purpose: refusing is already the safe action, and a boot
  #       loop would strand an environment nobody here can reach (there is no
  #       DBA and no database access) over a question only a human can answer.
  #   * = undefined, i.e. a signal death, and treated as unsafe when the sweep
  #       was requested — a SIGKILL can land after the transaction committed and

# a load-bearing order that was previously enforced by a comment in the Bicep
# param block; `useAppRoleAtRuntime` set on its own boots the app as a non-owner
# against tables that still filter it, the bearer lookup returns zero rows for
# every device, and the deploy stays green while the emit fleet stops. Refusing
# fails the revision instead, so the PREVIOUS revision keeps serving and the
# reason is named. This is also what lets the sweep's exit 4 stay non-fatal:
# refusing to sweep is safe while the owner still connects, and this gate is
