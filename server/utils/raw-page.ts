/*
 * readRawPage — read ONE provider response as an UNPARSED body, for the wire-shape
 * diagnostic (server/diagnostics/).
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS. Every provider client here returns a Zod-PARSED object, and a Zod
 * parse is lossy in exactly the two ways that would make a wire-shape report lie:
 *   - a non-passthrough object STRIPS undeclared keys, so a field the provider
 *     newly sends becomes invisible;
 *   - `.default(0)` FABRICATES a key that never arrived, so presence-counts read
 *     100% for a field the wire omitted.
 * Summarising the parsed object would therefore make the probe structurally
 * incapable of answering the question it exists to answer. It reads the body
 * before any schema touches it.
 *
 * It does NOT open a second HTTP path: the callers are thin methods on the
 * EXISTING clients that reuse those clients' own URL builders, headers and
 * resilientFetch. Nothing here knows about credentials.
 *
 * ERROR BODIES ARE RETURNED RAW, deliberately. A classified "safe" reason is a
 * lossy summary, and this project has repeatedly been sent to the wrong layer by
 * one — a 400 is a REQUEST error, never connectivity, and only the body says why.
 * The body is capped and scrubbed of any credential handed to `scrub` (an exact
 * substring match — cheap, and it can only remove).

 *
 * NO LENGTH FLOOR. This used to skip any secret shorter than 8 characters, on
 * the reasoning that a short value "would match everywhere and destroy the
 * message" and "a real credential is never this short". The second half is an
 * assumption about configuration, not a property of this function, and the
 * combination made the guarantee above conditional on it while stating it
 * unconditionally — a caller reading "the ones we hold cannot survive verbatim"
 * got silence instead for exactly the values most likely to be a misconfiguration.
 * Every non-empty secret is now removed. A pathologically short one will mangle
 * the error text, and that is the correct trade: a mangled message is recoverable
 * by looking at the configuration, a leaked credential is not. Empty / null /
 * undefined are still skipped — an empty needle matches at every position and
 * would shred the text while removing nothing.
