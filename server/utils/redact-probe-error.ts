/*
 * redact-probe-error — the ONE place a driver-level probe failure (Postgres,
 * an HTTP reader endpoint, DNS) turns into something safe to put in an HTTP
 * response, modelled on api/health.get.ts:29-37 (same postgres-js driver:
 * "log the real error server-side, return a static string to the caller").
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. A raw `err.message` from postgres-js or Node's network
 * stack routinely carries host, database name, and user (`connect ECONNREFUSED
 * 10.x.x.x:5432`, `password authentication failed for user "app"`) — exactly
 * the topology an unauthenticated-adjacent admin probe must not leak. But this
 * project has ALSO been burned by the opposite failure: a classified
 * "connect-failed" reason masking what was actually a 400 request error (see
 * feedback_classified_errors_mask_raw_cause). So the raw error is NEVER
 * dropped — it goes to the server log at full fidelity, tagged with a
 * correlation id the caller also receives, so an operator with log access can
 * always go from "the page says driver-unreachable, correlation abc123" to
 * the exact underlying error.
 *
 * Never interpolate any fragment of `err.message` (or any other error
 * property) into the returned reason — only the log line gets the raw value.
