/*
 * applyWorklistBulk — one decision applied to a SET of needs-tagging items.
 *
 * The worklist mixes two item kinds (a conversation and a provider-recorded
 * §A day) and supports three decisions (tag / dismiss / restore); this is the
 * single primitive behind all six combinations. Design:
 * docs/design/needs-tagging-worklist.md.
 *
 * ALL-OR-NOTHING. Every id is ownership-checked up front, and the tag path
 * delegates per item to the same primitives the single-item endpoints use
 * (tagSessionTx / tagUnaccountedTx), so their membership + ended-budget gates
 * apply unchanged. Any failure throws and the caller's transaction rolls the
 * whole batch back. A partial result would leave the developer unable to tell
 * which half landed on the one surface whose entire purpose is "clear the list".
 *
 * DISMISSAL IS NOT A LEDGER WRITE. dismiss/restore only move an item in or out
 * of the queue by stamping `dismissed_at`; no cost, project or activity changes,
 * and the spend keeps counting in the unallocated total. Tagging supersedes a
 * dismissal (both tag primitives clear `dismissed_at`), and a dismissal records
 * the AMOUNT it was about so it can be handed back when the item outgrows it
 * (sweepStaleDismissals).
 *
 * TAGGED XOR DISMISSED is a DB constraint (mig 0094), not a convention. This
 * module's job is to turn the two ways a client could reach for that state — a
 * stale tab dismissing something already tagged, or a dismissal racing a tag —
 * into a clean 409 instead of a constraint violation: the same per-conversation
 * advisory lock tagSessionTx takes, then a re-read of the current decision
 * inside that lock.
 *
 * MUST run inside a transaction.
