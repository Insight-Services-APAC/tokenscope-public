/*
 * reporting/cost-centres — the query layer behind the Cost-Centre reporting scope
 * (docs/design/reporting-consolidation/00-build-design.md §2/§3/§4/§5, Wave 3).
 *
 * ONE lane, end to end (the §A completeness lane, `v_complete_usage`): BOTH the
 * card grid AND the drill read the PROJECT-CoU USAGE axis
 * (`v_complete_usage WHERE cost_owning_unit_id`). The tracker card shows a CC's
 * BURN; drilling it shows WHO/WHAT is burning that budget (teammate / model
 * drivers), reconciling to the SAME burn — including a spender whose CURRENT
 * placement has moved (§A homes by emit-time cost_owning_unit_id, so they never
 * vanish). Copilot pooled rows carry NULL cost_owning_unit_id, so
 * `WHERE cost_owning_unit_id = ccId` excludes them by construction (the labelled
 * §A gap) — the per-CC burn is Claude-heavy.
 *
 * The one exception is the 'project' drill axis, and it is deliberate: a project
 * is clamped by its OWN cost-owning unit (`project.cost_owning_unit_id` — the
 * same column the allocation denominator uses), not by the usage row's, because
 * arm 2 of the lane carries a real project with a NULL cost-owning unit. It
 * therefore has its own denominator and says so; see fetchCostCentreBurnDrivers.
 *
 * The §B chargeback/billing DRILL for a cost centre (teammate-homed finance,
 * showback vs chargeable, pooled Copilot net) lives in the FINANCE scope's own CoU
 * drill — the burn DRILL here stays pure §A (it answers "who is consuming the
 * budget", not "who gets invoiced"). The card grid, however, carries a per-CC §B
 * `chargeUsd` alongside the §A burn (`fetchCostCentreCards`) so the list can re-lens
 * to the real charge in chargeback mode — read STRICTLY from the bill lane, on the
 * SAME grains the Across/Regional scopes use (grain-mismatch fix): Anthropic from the
 * DAILY per-teammate bill view (`v_finance_bill_chargeback`, `period_date`-windowed) +
 * the POOLED-MONTHLY Copilot net (`v_finance_copilot_pool_chargeback`) folded on top
 * only over a month-aligned window. NEVER summed with the §A `cost_usd` burn.
 *
 * The lane firewall (build-design §7(7), test-enforced over `server/reporting/**`)
 * bans `attribution_record` + raw `actual_spend` only: the §A burn reads
 * `v_complete_usage`; the §B `chargeUsd` reads the `v_finance_bill_chargeback` /
 * `v_finance_copilot_pool_chargeback` views (the bill lane's own surfaces, not raw
 * `actual_spend`). The two lanes are kept side-by-side but never mixed.
 *
 * These are the SAME functions `/reports/export` calls, so the CSV is
 * byte-identical to the screen figures (build-design §2 "byte-identical rule").

 * `CcDrill.vue` used to claim this column needed a `model_catalog.tier` that
 * "does not exist". It exists, is CHECK-constrained and is seeded (mig
 * `0046:128`, `0046:138-146`), two shipped engines already join it, and
 * `MODEL_TIER_BANDS` is a finished contract. What was missing was one query
 * over primitives that were already there — an implementation gap, not a
 * blocked dependency (`CLAUDE.md` §Decision discipline).
 *
 * ── BANDING IS `resolveTier`'s, NEVER THIS MODULE's ──────────────────────────
 * The catalogue matches by SUBSTRING with a `sort_order` tie-break, so
 * `gpt-5-mini` matches BOTH the `gpt-5-mini` row and the `gpt-5` row. A SQL
 * equijoin fans out and returns the same dollar once per matching pattern,
 * overstating every band. `resolveTier` — the function the frontier-share
 * detector already uses — resolves each model to exactly one tier before a
 * dollar is added, so a fan-out is structurally impossible and this column can
 * never publish a different frontier share from that detector.
 *
 * ── `unclassified` IS A BAND, NOT A DEFAULT ──────────────────────────────────
 * A model the catalogue does not know lands in `unclassified` and is NEVER
 * folded into the cheapest band: folding it would understate frontier exposure
 * by exactly the spend nobody has classified yet, which is the spend most
 * likely to be new and dear.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT COVER ────────────────────────────────────
 * A row whose `model` is NULL carries no model to band. That is a DIFFERENT
 * fact from "a model we have not classified" (prototype note `data`), and
 * `ModelTierBand` has no member for it, so that spend is OMITTED from the mix
 * rather than assigned a band it does not have. The mix therefore describes the
 * banded part of a person's spend; it is a proportional indicator, and nothing
 * foots a total to it.

     *
     * It does NOT hold the TAGGABLE untagged money — someone's emitted spend
     * that simply has not been put on a project yet. Both §A writers set the CoU
     * FROM the project and leave it NULL when there is none (`tag-session.ts`,

 * WHY THIS IS NOT THE BURN CLAMP, and must not become it. Every other query in this
 * module clamps `u.cost_owning_unit_id = ccId`, which is the cost centre OF THE
 * TAGGED PROJECT. That is right for a burn figure and catastrophic for a card about
 * spend with NO project on it: the reconciled arm carries NULL there by construction
 * and untagged emitted spend has no project to take a unit from, so a burn-clamped
 * scan omits exactly the people the card exists to surface. The population is
 * therefore `teammate.org_unit_id`, and the returned predicate addresses the roster
 * alias `t`, never the usage alias `u` (server/reporting/engine/over-soft-cap.ts).
 *
 * THE SUBTREE, not `org_unit_id = ccId`. Both placement doors are live and they
 * differ: the bulk PLACE action refuses a non-cost-owning target
 * (`placeTeammate`, 'cost-owning-only'), but the per-row /admin/users move accepts
 * any active unit in the region ('any-active-unit'), so people genuinely sit on
 * plain `team` nodes BELOW a cost centre. Clamping to the id alone would drop them
 * from their own cost centre's roster while their spend still homed to it. Reuses
 * `orgSubtreeIds` — the region clamp inside it is load-bearing, because org_unit
 * paths are unique only per region.
 *
 * NO NEW RBAC. The caller has already been authorised against this cc by
 * {@link resolveCostCentreDrill} (owner OR region/subtree); this reads one row by
 * primary key to turn that id into its path.

 *                the clamp `fetchCostCentreTierExposure` and

 * THE UNALIASED TWIN, and it is not a stylistic choice. `fetchUsageWeeklyLanes`
 * selects `FROM v_complete_usage` with NO alias, so a `u.`-qualified predicate
 * does not resolve there — and because the mismatch is a missing correlation
 * name, Postgres REJECTS the statement outright with "missing FROM-clause entry
 * for table \"u\"" — the request 500s rather than quietly returning no rows. (An
 * earlier revision of this comment said it would "simply draw nothing", which is
 * the opposite of what happened and would have sent the next reader looking for
 * a data problem instead of an error.) `fetchRegionalUsageWeeklyLanes` uses the unaliased
 * form for exactly this reason. Two clamps, each named for the query shape it
 * belongs to, is cheaper than one clamp that is silently wrong half the time.
