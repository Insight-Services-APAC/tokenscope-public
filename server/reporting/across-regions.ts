/*
 * reporting/across-regions — the query layer behind the Across-Regions reporting
 * scope (docs/design/reporting-consolidation/00-build-design.md §2/§3/§4/§5).
 *
 * WHOLE-OF-COMPANY. This scope has no region/ou params — it is the enterprise
 * rollup, and its ONLY audience is global-finops / platform-admin (RBAC enforced
 * in the endpoints via requireRole; there is no per-caller scope predicate to
 * apply because there is nothing to clamp — it is every region). RLS is inert at
 * runtime (see server/db/request-rls.ts), so a query with no scope clause sums
 * the entire company, exactly as intended.
 *
 * ONE lane per axis (build-design §4):
 *   - KPIs / region cards / drivers / concentration → `v_complete_usage` (the §A
 *     completeness lane: attribution ∪ the API−OTel gap), `region_id` grain.
 *   - the monetised genuine-vs-chargeable pair → `v_finance_chargeback_month`
 *     (the §B bill lane), region grain. The Copilot chargeable is gated on
 *     `copilot.mode` (build-design §6 interim labelling) — held back with a
 *     "pending" marker until Wave 0 validates on Dev.
 * No reporting query here touches `attribution_record` or raw `actual_spend`
 * (the lane firewall, build-design §7(7) — test-enforced over BOTH
 * `server/api/v1/reports/**` and `server/reporting/**`).
 *
 * These are the SAME functions `/reports/export` calls, so the CSV is
 * byte-identical to the screen figures (build-design §2 "byte-identical rule").
