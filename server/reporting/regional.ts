/*
 * reporting/regional — the query layer behind the Regional reporting scope
 * (docs/design/reporting-consolidation/00-build-design.md §2/§3/§4/§5).
 *
 * ONE lane per axis (build-design §4):
 *   - usage KPIs / ranking / drivers / trend / exceptions → `v_complete_usage`
 *     (the §A completeness lane: attribution ∪ the API−OTel gap). Homed by
 *     `org_unit_id` (the point-in-time emit home) — the Regional usage axis is
 *     already point-in-time "as at emit" (owner-decisions D-Homing).
 *   - the monetised genuine-vs-chargeable pair → `v_finance_chargeback_month`
 *     (the §B bill lane), region/subtree grain.
 * No reporting query here touches `attribution_record` or raw `actual_spend`
 * (the lane firewall, build-design §7(7) — test-enforced over BOTH
 * `server/api/v1/reports/**` and `server/reporting/**`). The Copilot chargeable
 * is gated on `copilot.mode` (build-design §6 interim labelling).
 *
 * These are the SAME functions `/reports/export` calls, so the CSV is
 * byte-identical to the screen figures (build-design §2 "byte-identical rule").
