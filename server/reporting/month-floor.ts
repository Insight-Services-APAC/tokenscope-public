/*
 * The reporting month floor — the earliest month with any usage in a scope.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS FOR. Two things, both cheap consumers: the month picker's lower
 * bound, and a server-side 400 for a month below it (server/reporting/params.ts
 * resolveReportMonth). Neither needs sub-second freshness.
 *
 * WHY IT NEEDED FIXING. Three copies of this query existed — regional.ts,
 * across-regions.ts and cost-centres.ts — and every one of them scanned
 * v_complete_usage with NO DATE PREDICATE AT ALL. Alone among every query on
 * the reporting page, the floor was not bounded by the selected window, so it
 * read the entire history on every request: ~580MB of blocks against ~67MB for
 * the query that answers the user's actual question, spilling 13.8MB to disk,
 * 241ms. Because it is unbounded it gets STRICTLY SLOWER every month the
 * deployment runs, forever, while answering a question whose value changes at
 * most monthly.
 *
 * WHY A CACHE RATHER THAN A BOUND. The floor is a MIN over all history, so
 * there is no window to narrow it to without changing the answer. What makes it
 * cheap is that the answer is near-static: it moves when the first data lands,
 * when the archive worker retires the oldest month, and — the case that matters
 * — when a recovery or backfill worker inserts HISTORY EARLIER than anything
 * seen before, which lowers the floor.
 *
 * That last case is why callers must not reject a month on a cached value
 * alone. Instances do not share this cache, so after a backfill one instance
 * can hold a later floor than another for a whole TTL, and the floor is
 * enforced as a 400 — the symptom would be a request being refused a month
 * whose data has just been restored, on one instance but not its neighbour.
 * `confirmBelowFloor` exists for exactly that: it re-reads UNCACHED before a
 * rejection, which keeps the cache a pure latency optimisation and makes a
 * stale entry unable to produce a wrong answer, only a briefly-wide picker.
 *
 * The scope predicate is part of the key, deliberately: a cost-centre owner's
 * floor is not the whole company's, and sharing one global floor would let a
 * scope-below-floor month through. Semantics here are EXACTLY what the three
 * copies did; only the number of times it runs has changed.
