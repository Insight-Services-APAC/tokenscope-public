/*
 * reporting/teammate — the E3 CONTRIBUTION view of one named individual
 * (developer pages build D31-D34; evidence annex :784-798).
 *
 * It lives here, inside `server/reporting/**`, and not under `server/usage/**`
 * or `me/*`, for one reason stated in three places (00-brief.md:39-49, D32,
 * annex :557-561): this directory and `server/api/v1/reports/**` are the two
 * scan roots of the lane firewall AND the two dirs the per-literal-endpoint
 * 200/403 suite enumerates. A manager-facing named-individual page anywhere
 * else would need the grants model but be invisible to the tests that pin where
 * the grants model reaches — a second, unproven RBAC path.
 *
 * ── C14: THE QUERY CARRIES THE ENTRY SCOPE PREDICATE, NEVER A BARE ID ────────
 * Every SUBJECT figure below is computed over `v_complete_usage` filtered by
 * (subject ∧ window ∧ the scope predicate the `?src=` frame resolved to). The
 * pinned outcome: alice's `apac.cto` driver row says 100
 * (known-outcome-validation.test.ts:214-220) and the drill opened from it must
 * head at 100 — never her personal 350, 250 of which homes to a scope the
 * viewer does not hold (annex :893-901).
 *
 * ── THE ONE DELIBERATE EXCEPTION: THE TOKENSHEET DENOMINATORS (r1-H3) ────────
 * "Share of project" and the budget state are WHOLE-PROJECT figures over ALL
 * members, computed with NO scope predicate, beside a scope-filtered numerator.
 * That is sanctioned, not a leak: the budget belongs to the PROJECT, so the
 * project total vs allocation is visible to everyone in scope (annex :532-543).
 * A scoped denominator would render 100% shares and misstate every budget
 * position — the exact error :536-540 describes.
 *
 * ── LANE ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `v_complete_usage` only, for every figure. No `attribution_record`, no raw
 * `actual_spend`, no `attribution_aggregate` — the firewall scans this file
 * (tests/unit/server/reports-lane-firewall.test.ts:29) and the me-side series
 * helpers all read the banned aggregate, which is why none of them is reused
 * here (annex :883-891 limits sanctioned reuse to `resolveReportWindow`,
 * `providerStatesForWindow`, `reportCoverageMeta` and `projections.ts`).
