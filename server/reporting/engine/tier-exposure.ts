/*
 * fetchTierExposure — billed spend against consumption, banded by model tier,
 * scope-parameterised (docs/design/reporting-consolidation/04-prototype-delta.md
 * §5 `fetchTierExposure`).
 *
 * WHAT IT ANSWERS. "Behavioural exposure": each band is one thing a developer or
 * a policy can change, and the card shows money over volume in the SAME bands so
 * the premium is visible. A spend share alone overstates how much a thing is
 * used, because every band bills at a different rate.
 *
 * THE LANE. `provider_usage_fact` — the NORMALISED layer, not an Anthropic
 * surface (`0118:44-45`: `provider text NOT NULL`, no CHECK on the value, both
 * providers landing through their own adapter). A report reads the normalised
 * layer and nothing else, so this card is never blocked on an unwritten adapter:
 * it reports what has arrived and gains the rest when the arm lands.
 *
 * ONE `GROUP BY` YIELDS BOTH MEASURES. The measure-exclusivity CHECK
 * (`0118:141-165`) makes a cost row carry no tokens and a token row carry no
 * cost, so `SUM(cost_usd)` ignores token rows and `SUM(input+output)` ignores
 * cost rows. Nothing multiplies when both reports are loaded, and no filter or
 * merged view is needed.
 *
 * BANDING HAPPENS IN TYPESCRIPT, THROUGH `resolveTier` — DELIBERATELY, and this
 * is the single most load-bearing decision in the file. `model_catalog` matches
 * by SUBSTRING with a `sort_order` tie-break (`0046:122-146`), so `gpt-5-mini`
 * matches BOTH the `gpt-5-mini` row (sort_order 50, lightweight) and the `gpt-5`
 * row (70, frontier). A direct equijoin fans out: the SAME dollar is returned
 * twice, once per matching pattern, and every band total — and the card's
 * headline — overstates the money. Calling `resolveTier` (the function the
 * frontier-share detector already uses) resolves each model to exactly one tier
 * before a single dollar is added anywhere, so a fan-out is not merely avoided,
 * it is structurally impossible: there is no join. It also means this card and
 * that detector can never publish two different frontier shares.
 *
 * NEVER a §A usage figure, never `attribution_record` / `attribution_aggregate` /
 * raw `actual_spend` (the lane firewall, build-design §7(7)).
