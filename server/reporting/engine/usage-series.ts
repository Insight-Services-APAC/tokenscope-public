 * DEFINED as an aggregate of v_complete_usage (docs/design/usage-rollup-lane.md
 * R5; both reads here are day/week-grain, so the rollup serves them exactly).
 * Consistency contract C2 is "one lane per axis,
 * firewall-enforced", and §A and §B answer different questions on different
 * grains — a figure from one must never be summed with a figure from the other
 * (docs/design/provider-billing-attribution-model.md). Keeping them in one file

/**
 * The canonical §A weekly lane series over the window: usage_rollup_daily
 * grouped by ISO week × tool, tools folded to registry lane ids by
 * mergeWeeklyLaneRows. ISO week derives from `day` (usage-rollup-lane.md R5) —
 * every arm-2/3 row was day-grain already, and arm-1 intra-day times were never
 * load-bearing for a week bucket.
 *
 * EVERY §A surface rides this natively, including copilot and copilot-agent —
 * there is no GitHub firewall here, because that firewall exists only to keep
 * usage-basis rows out of a BILLED view, and this view IS the usage basis.
 *
 * Σ cells over a window equals the same scope's `genuineUsd` headline for that
 * window, cent-exactly (test-pinned) — which is the property that stops this
 * hero disagreeing with the KPI above it. NOT zero-filled: the client's week
 * axis does that, and a week with no usage is a gap in this series rather than
 * a claimed zero. NEVER summed with a §B chargeback figure.

 * Per-day §A usage over the window: spend, tokens and the people who SPENT that
 * day (Σ `cost_usd` positive — the same definition `fetchKpiCore.activeUsers`
 * uses, because this series is the sparkline drawn under that number).
 *
 * ZERO-FILLED across every day of the window THAT HAS ALREADY HAPPENED, and no
 * further (generate_series LEFT JOIN the aggregate). Both halves are
 * load-bearing, because this feeds a sparkline:
 *
 *   - a PAST day with no in-scope usage IS emitted, as a genuine 0 — we looked
 *     and found none, and dropping it would compress scattered activity into
 *     contiguous points and misstate the shape of the month;
 *   - a FUTURE day is NOT emitted, because nothing has been measured there. On
 *     day 3 of a 31-day month the old axis padded 28 zeros to the right edge,
 *     which draws as "spend collapsed to zero on day 4 and never recovered" —
 *     an assertion about days that have not occurred.
 *
 * The generated axis' upper bound is therefore
 *
 *   LEAST( endDate - 1 day,                          -- never past the window
 *          GREATEST( clock.settledThrough,           -- never past the settled edge …
 *                    MAX(day carrying in-scope data) ) )  -- … unless data exists
 *
 * `window.endIso` is EXCLUSIVE, so the first arm stops the axis one day before
 * it exactly as before. The `GREATEST` arm is NOT cosmetic: a row timestamped
 * beyond the edge still counts in the window's headline, so without it that row
 * would be dropped from the series while remaining in the total, silently
 * breaking Σ(series) === headline (test-pinned). A window whose start is after
 * the bound yields NO rows, which is the correct answer: nothing in it has
 * happened yet.
 *
 * ── THE EDGE IS `settledThrough`, NOT `CURRENT_DATE` (fix-sprint F1/D2) ──────
 * This arm read `CURRENT_DATE`, and the doc comment argued the case: "CURRENT_DATE
 * is the DATA clock — the DB and the app share a deployment." Under D3 that is
 * exactly the reasoning being retired. SQL's `CURRENT_DATE` is a *third* clock
 * (after the server's and the browser's), and it is a WALL-CLOCK fact where the
 * axis needs a COVERAGE fact. The gap between the two is the morning dip:
 * `CURRENT_DATE` pulls the axis onto a day that is three hours old at 09:00
 * Sydney, the LEFT JOIN pads it to 0, and the chart draws a collapse.
 * `settledThrough` — the last COMPLETE UTC day — stops the axis where the data
 * is finished, and today appears only if it genuinely carries rows (the MAX(day)
 * arm), where the client draws it partial. Fixing only the browser MOVES the
 * dip; this is where it actually lives.
 *
 * `clock` is a REQUIRED parameter and this query holds NO clock of its own. That
 * is the contract: one resolution, made at the endpoint boundary, seen by the
 * SQL and the browser alike — which is also what makes a deterministic "today"
 * testable at all.
 *
 * The lane is aliased `u` and clamps must address `u.region_id` /
 * `u.org_unit_id`. That is not cosmetic: the regional caller's predicate is
 * built by `scope.usageScope('u.region_id', 'u.org_unit_id')`, so the alias
 * here is part of this function's contract with its callers.
