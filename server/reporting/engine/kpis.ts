/*
 * The reporting KPI row, scope-parameterised — ONE implementation for the
 * regional and whole-company headline tiles that previously carried a copy each.
 *
 * The pair these replace were line-identical once the scope predicate was
 * normalised away, across FIVE queries (§A totals, the month floor, the §B daily
 * bill grain, the §B pooled Copilot month, and the previous-month chargeback
 * operand) plus the composition that turns them into tiles. Every fix therefore
 * had to be applied twice, and a fix applied to one copy only is a silent
 * divergence between two surfaces that report the same money at two scopes.
 *
 * WHY THIS MODULE READS BOTH LANES, when every other engine module reads one.
 * The KPI row is the one place a §A figure and a §B figure are rendered side by
 * side: `genuineUsd` is USAGE (v_complete_usage — what the company consumed) and
 * `chargeableUsd` / `prevChargeableUsd` / `billedTokens` / `billedTeammates` are
 * BILL (the v_finance_* views — what is charged back). They are never summed
 * with each other here, and no returned field mixes them: the two lanes answer
 * different questions on different grains
 * (docs/design/provider-billing-attribution-model.md, consistency contract C2).
 *
 * That is precisely why the scope argument is a PAIR of separately-lane-typed
 * clamps rather than one predicate: §A clamps address (region_id, org_unit_id)
 * and §B clamps address (region_id, cost_owning_unit_id), so passing either one
 * where the other belongs is a compile error (engine/scope.ts `Lane`), not a
 * quietly smaller number.
