/*
 * The §A per-person cohort a reporting KPI row publishes, scope-parameterised —
 * ONE implementation for the whole-company and single-region widths.
 *
 * WHY IT MOVED HERE. This was `fetchAcrossPerPerson` in across-regions.ts, on the
 * reasoning that only the whole-company width rendered a Median-per-person tile.
 * That was an accident of which width got the prototype's fix 6 applied to it, not
 * a property of the scopes: a region owner has exactly the same question ("what
 * does a typical person here spend, and how lopsided is it"), and the Region width
 * simply never had the tile built. Rather than write a second cohort query for it
 * — the divergence engine/scope.ts exists to prevent — the query takes a clamp.
 *
 * ONE FACT, ONE HOME (prototype fix 6): the median is what a typical person spends
 * and the three percentiles are how lopsided that is — the same question asked
 * twice, so they travel together on one tile rather than as a KPI and a separate
 * Concentration band that disagreed with it.
