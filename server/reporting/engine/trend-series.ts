/*
 * engine/trend-series — the §A day-grained trend reads, for ANY scope.
 *
 * ── WHY THESE MOVED ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Both of these lived in `reporting/regional.ts` typed to a `RegionalScope`, and
 * exactly one line in each was region-specific: the WHERE predicate. That is the
 * whole reason the cost-centre scope had no spend trend and no active-developer
 * trend while the approved prototype has always drawn both on it — the code was
 * reachable only by a caller that could produce a `RegionalScope`.
 *
 * Taking a `UsageScope` instead is the same generalisation `fetchKpiCore`,
 * `fetchDailyMetrics` and `fetchPerPerson` already made, and it is what makes a
 * second implementation unnecessary. Copying these into `cost-centres.ts` was
 * the alternative, and it is precisely how the two Region widths drifted into
 * publishing different KPI rows before they were merged onto one component.
 *
 * ── ONE BEHAVIOURAL DIFFERENCE, DELIBERATE ───────────────────────────────────
 * `scopeSql()` parenthesises the predicate; the region call sites inlined it
 * bare. For a self-parenthesised predicate (which `org-subtree-scope.ts:48`
 * produces) the SQL is equivalent, so region output is unchanged — pinned by
 * `tests/integration/reports/regional.test.ts` and `seasonality-active-trend.test.ts`,
 * both green before and after the move. The parens are strictly safer: an
 * unwrapped top-level OR re-associates against the window and returns history
 * (see the reasoning on `scopeSql` itself).
