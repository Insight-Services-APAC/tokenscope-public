/*
 * §A unallocated spend over the SOFT CAP, scope-parameterised — the cost-centre
 * lead's conversation list (docs/design/reporting-consolidation/04-prototype-delta.md
 * §5, order item 2).
 *
 * THE CLAIM: unallocated spend over the soft cap should be on a budget.
 *
 * ── THE CAP IS AN EXISTING POLICY, NOT A THRESHOLD INVENTED HERE ─────────────
 * `NUXT_BASE_ALLOWANCE_USD` (server/utils/base-allowance.ts, default 100) is ONE
 * GLOBAL CONSTANT, and the developer's own page already badges `over_soft_cap`
 * against it per person (server/utils/me-queries.ts). This applies the SAME policy
 * to the manager's view, through the SAME function, with the SAME `>=` comparison
 * — a `>` here would list a developer as within allowance whose own page badges
 * them Over, and neither reader could tell which surface was lying.
 *
 * Two earlier drafts of this card invented gates — a $250 materiality floor, then a
 * 60% tagging rate. Both were guesses and both were unnecessary. THE RATE IS NOT A
 * GATE: someone tagging 88% of a large total can still leave 8× the cap
 * unallocated, and filtering on the rate would drop exactly the heavy user who most
 * needs the nudge. Only the cap gates; the rate rides along as context.
 *
 * ── ROSTER-ANCHORED, NOT BURN-ANCHORED ──────────────────────────────────────
 * The obvious query — scan `v_complete_usage WHERE cost_owning_unit_id = <cc>` —
 * is wrong for this card, and wrong in the direction that hides the problem.
 * `cost_owning_unit_id` on the §A lane is the cost centre OF THE TAGGED PROJECT
 * (server/usage/complete-spend.ts), so:
 *
 *   - the reconciled arm (`unaccounted_usage`, mig 0101/0113) carries NULL there BY
 *     CONSTRUCTION — every Copilot reconciliation row included;
 *   - untagged emitted spend carries NULL there too, because there is no project to
 *     take a cost centre from.
 *
 * A burn-anchored scan therefore omits, specifically and silently, the people whose
 * spend is not on a budget — which is the entire population this card exists to
 * surface. So the FROM clause is the ROSTER (teammate placement), usage is LEFT
 * JOINed onto it, and the denominator is named separately from project burn
 * (`rosterUsd`, never "burn") so no reader can reconcile the two and conclude one is
 * broken.
 *
 * ── THE CLAMP ADDRESSES `t`, THE ROSTER — NOT `u`, THE USAGE LANE ───────────
 * Every other §A engine primitive takes a clamp over `u.region_id` / `u.org_unit_id`
 * on `v_complete_usage`, which are EMIT-TIME dimensions (point-in-time, as at the
 * event). This one takes a clamp over `t.region_id` / `t.org_unit_id` on `teammate`
 * — CURRENT placement. They are genuinely different questions and the alias
 * difference is what keeps them from being confused: `u` is not in scope where this
 * predicate is applied, so a clamp written for the usage lane raises "missing
 * FROM-clause entry for table u" rather than silently answering a different one.
 *
 * That is why the scope predicate is applied at the OUTER level only. Pushing it
 * into the usage sub-select would put `u` in scope beside `t` and turn that loud
 * failure into a silent correlated capture.
 *
 * ── NO ACTION BUTTONS, AND THE RETURNED SHAPE CARRIES NONE ──────────────────
 * `tagUnaccountedTx` (server/utils/tag-unaccounted.ts) permits only a record's OWN
 * teammate to tag it, so a cost-centre owner cannot action another person's row.
 * Nothing here returns a record id, an action or an affordance — the payload is a
 * name, an amount and a reason to make contact.
 *
 * ── LANE ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Pure §A: `v_complete_usage` for the money, `teammate` / `project_assignment` /
 * `project` for the population and the memberships. No bill-lane figure is an
 * operand (consistency contract C2), and no raw ledger table is read (the lane
 * firewall, tests/unit/server/reports-lane-firewall.test.ts).

/**
 * Unallocated spend over the soft cap for one scope and window.
 *
 * @param scope  A §A clamp addressing **`t.region_id` / `t.org_unit_id`** on the
 *               `teammate` roster — CURRENT placement, not the emit-time dimensions
 *               the usage lane carries. See the module header.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS PRIMITIVE DECIDES, AND WHAT THE CALLER DECIDES ────────────────
 * The caller's scope decides WHICH cost centre. Everything else is policy and lives
 * here, once, so no caller can ship a variant of it:
 *
 *   - `t.is_active = TRUE`. A roster is the people who are HERE. This is the same
 *     definition of occupancy the rest of the product already uses for a unit's
 *     headcount (server/api/v1/admin/org-units.get.ts counts placements with
 *     `is_active = TRUE`; org-units/[id].delete.ts guards on "the home of any ACTIVE
 *     teammate"), so `rosterCount` IS the cost centre's placement count rather than a
 *     second, differently-drawn population. The consequence is stated rather than
 *     hidden: a deactivated leaver's unallocated spend is not in `rosterUsd`. That is
 *     deliberate — every row on this card is a person to contact, and a leaver is not
 *     one — and `rosterUsd` is named as the roster's total, never as the centre's.
 *
 *   - UNALLOCATED = `project_id IS NULL`, over ALL THREE §A arms. Identical to the
 *     definition the developer's own page sums (getUnallocatedSummary reads arms 1
 *     and 2 from their own tables for the worklist identity it needs, and arm 3
 *     through this same view), so the number a manager reads is the number the
 *     developer sees. Arm 3 IS included even though it is untaggable: the developer's
 *     own unallocated total counts it (ADR 0012 decision 1a), so excluding it here
 *     would put a smaller figure in front of the manager than the person they are
 *     about to call is looking at.
 *
 *   - ACTIVE MEMBERSHIP = `effective @> now()` AND NOT `endedProjectExpr` — the SAME
 *     two gates `tagUnaccountedTx` applies before it will accept a tag. Evaluated at
 *     `now()`, not over the window, because the question is "could they tag this
 *     today", which is a fact about now. That agreement is the whole point of the
 *     split: a nudge sent to someone whose only projects have ENDED is an instruction
 *     they cannot follow — the write path would 409 them — so they belong in
 *     `on-no-project`, where the action is a PM's.
 *
 * ── THE TWO IDENTITIES THIS RETURNS, AND WHY THEY HOLD ──────────────────────
 *   `allocatedUsd + unallocatedUsd = rosterUsd` — two FILTER aggregates over one
 *   scan, split on a NOT NULL / IS NULL pair, so they partition by construction.
 *
 *   `over.length + withinAllowance.teammates = rosterCount` — every roster row takes
 *   exactly one branch of one `if` below. Mutually exclusive and exhaustive.
