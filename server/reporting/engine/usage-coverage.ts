/*
 * §A budget coverage, scope-parameterised — the denominator a reporting surface
 * publishes beside the total it qualifies.
 *
 * WHY. Under 5% of enterprise consumption is on a budgeted project, so every
 * budget-shaped figure is a small fraction of real consumption and nothing on
 * screen said so ("Four — make reports honest about coverage",
 * docs/design/reporting-stakeholder-visibility/00-decisions.md §5b). This answers
 * the one question that closes that gap for a given scope and window: how much of
 * the consumption is inside the budget lens, and how much is outside it.
 *
 * ── SAME LANE, SAME WINDOW, SAME CLAMP AS THE HEADLINE ───────────────────────
 * ONE scan of usage_rollup_daily (the day-grain §A rollup the headline itself
 * reads — usage-rollup-lane.md R5; `project_id` and `usage_provenance` are both
 * in the rollup grain, so every FILTER below tests a cell dim, never a per-row
 * measure), clamped by the caller's UsageScope over the same
 * window the surface's own KPI used. That is what makes `totalUsd` the surface's
 * headline rather than a second opinion about it: the four parts are FILTER
 * aggregates over the same scan, so they foot to the total by construction and
 * cannot drift from it.
 *
 * NOT a project-spend producer, so it is deliberately absent from the PRODUCERS
 * list in tests/unit/server/project-spend-one-lane.test.ts. It publishes no
 * project's spend: `budgetedUsd` is a scope-grain aggregate over the budget
 * PREDICATE, never a per-project total, and no caller can decompose it back to
 * one. "Project spend this month" still has exactly one source
 * (server/usage/complete-spend.ts) and this module does not touch it, nor does it
 * move any lane read out of a pinned file — it adds a new one here.
 *
 * SEPARATE FROM usage-series.ts for the reason chargeback-series.ts is separate:
 * this one joins `allocation`, and the budget axis is a different question from
 * "what did this scope consume". Keeping it here means a change to what "budgeted"
 * means is one file, greppable, rather than a clause buried in a series query.

/**
 * The §A budget-coverage decomposition for one scope and window.
 *
 * `scopeLabel` IS AN ARGUMENT, not an inference, and it is required rather than
 * optional. The copy beside these figures names the scope they were summed over, and
 * the only place that name is knowable is the resolver that built `scope` — the
 * predicate is an opaque SQL fragment by the time it reaches here, and it is opaque
 * again by the time the number reaches a component. Requiring it means a new producer
 * of these figures cannot ship without deciding whose money it is publishing, which is
 * how the previous version got it wrong: the component guessed from `drill ?? region`
 * and named the whole region above one manager's subtree. Pass `null` ONLY when the
 * clamp genuinely resolves to no scope at all (see UsageBudgetCoverage.scopeLabel).
 *
 * The lane is aliased `u` and clamps must address `u.region_id` / `u.org_unit_id`
 * — the same contract `fetchDailyMetrics` has with its callers, and not cosmetic:
 * the query LEFT JOINs a second relation, so an unqualified `region_id` in a
 * caller's predicate would be ambiguous rather than merely untidy.
 *
 * PROVISIONAL IDENTITY IS INCLUDED, deliberately. The project-spend seam offers
 * `excludeProvisional` because a manager-facing project figure must not move on an
 * unconfirmed device binding; a reporting headline has no such option and counts
 * every row. This qualifies THAT headline, so it must count the same rows — an
 * exclusion here would make the parts stop footing to the total they sit beside.
 *
 * BUDGETED = an allocation of kind `baseline` or `top-up`, on the PROJECT axis,
 * carrying a non-zero amount, whose effective range OVERLAPS the window (`&&`)
 * rather than containing a single instant. Each of those four clauses is load-bearing:
 *
 *   - `scope_type = 'project'` — `allocation.scope_id` is a bare uuid with no FK, and
 *     the same table holds region/platform/teammate-scoped rows. Without the clamp a
 *     region budget whose id collided with a project's would fund that project.
 *   - `allocation_kind IN ('baseline','top-up')` — a top-up IS budget (D10: one budget
 *     axis, the project); a baseline-only predicate would report a topped-up project
 *     as unbudgeted.
 *   - `budget_usd > 0` — see below.
 *   - OVERLAP — a budget raised or first set mid-window is real budget for that window;
 *     `budget-alert` applies the same overlap rule to top-ups for the same reason.
 *
 * A $0 ALLOCATION IS NOT A BUDGET, decided here. Nothing stops one being written —
 * `budget_usd` is NUMERIC(14,2) NOT NULL with no positivity check, and both write
 * paths (`BudgetUsdSchema`, split.post.ts's cap regex) accept "0" — so the question
 * has an answer either way and silence would pick one by accident. It is excluded,
 * because the covered figure is read through the copy beside it: "is on a project
 * that had a budget for it". A project allocated $0 had no budget for it, and
 * counting it would move real spend into the covered bucket and overstate exactly
 * the share this decomposition exists to keep honest ("Four — make reports honest
 * about coverage"). ADR 0012's follow-up names the same shape as a defect in the
 * quota model: contributed-but-unbudgeted projects counted into a numerator with
 * $0 behind them, inflating the percentage. Its spend is reported as
 * tagged-but-unbudgeted, which is what it is.
 *
 * DISTINCT in the CTE so a project with a baseline AND two top-ups joins once —
 * without it, its spend would be counted three times and the parts would over-foot
 * the total.
 *
 * A PER-DEVELOPER CAP COUNTS, and `teammate_id` is deliberately unfiltered. Under
 * `allocation_mode = 'per_dev_fixed'` a project's budget IS the set of per-dev caps
 * — modelled (mig 0008) as project-scoped rows carrying a `teammate_id`, the pool
 * baseline being the same shape with `teammate_id` NULL. Adding `teammate_id IS
 * NULL` here would report a per-dev-funded project as unbudgeted, which is the
 * error the `allocation_kind` clause above already avoids for top-ups.
 *
 * What that does NOT claim: coverage is measured at PROJECT grain, and a per-dev
 * cap is at (project, teammate) grain. Spend by a developer who has no cap of their
 * own on a per_dev_fixed project still lands in the covered bucket. That is the
 * same grain the pool case already has — a $1 baseline marks a $50k project
 * budgeted — because the predicate is "had a budget for it", a membership test, not
 * "was within budget", an adequacy one. Adequacy is the budget-alert surface's
 * question, not this one's.
 *
 * In practice the per-dev rows change nothing: their only writer
 * (`allocations/{id}/split.post.ts`) requires an existing pool baseline on the same
 * project, stamps each cap with that pool's exact `effective`, and rejects
 * sum(caps) > pool budget — so a cap over $0 cannot exist without a pool row that
 * already satisfies this predicate, and DISTINCT makes the overlap free. That is a
 * write-path property and not an invariant: `allocations/{id}.patch.ts` will edit
 * any single row's amount or range afterwards without re-checking the relation. So
 * the clause is justified above on its own terms rather than on the redundancy, and
 * tests/integration/reports/usage-budget-coverage.test.ts pins both halves.
