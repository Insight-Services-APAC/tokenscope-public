/*
 * reporting/teammate-freshness — the operand behind the teammate drill's
 * STALENESS REFUSAL (developer pages build D36, r1-H5 + r2-H1).
 *
 * ── WHY THIS IS NOT `reportCoverageMeta` (r1-H5) ────────────────────────────
 * That helper returns an estate-wide GitHub-enterprise CENSUS marker with a
 * boolean `stale` and no timestamp (`server/reports/coverage-meta.ts:29-52`).
 * It answers "can we claim completeness of the org list", not "how old is the
 * money we are about to publish about a named person". It stays chip-only.
 *
 * ── WHY A REFUSAL AND NOT A CAVEAT ──────────────────────────────────────────
 * On a governance surface about a named individual, a stale figure is a
 * finding-shaped defamation risk, not a caveat (annex :926-928). Self and member
 * depths do NOT refuse — a stale figure about yourself is a caveat, and the chip
 * row discloses it (D14).
 *
 * ── THE STALEST RELEVANT PROVIDER DECIDES (r2-H1) ───────────────────────────
 * RELEVANCE is subject-scoped: only providers actually present in the subject's
 * in-window, in-scope rows can gate the page. An irrelevant provider's stale
 * clock must not refuse a page it contributed nothing to.
 *
 * And "present" means PRESENT AS A SOURCE, not merely as a vendor label. An
 * `otel-emitted` row (arm 1) is emitted live by the client and reaches the lane
 * without any provider pull, so no provider clock says anything about how fresh
 * it is; refusing an OTel-only subject because a provider nobody polls has never
 * been observed would withhold figures that are, in fact, current — and would
 * make the whole drill unreachable on an estate that emits but does not
 * reconcile. Rows whose provenance IS provider-fed (`api-reconciled`,
 * `provider-usage`) are exactly the rows a stale pull would misstate, and they
 * are the ones that gate.
 *
 * The CLOCK is per relevant SOURCE and UNWINDOWED:
 * `MAX(provider_usage_fact.pulled_at)` for each `(provider, source)` that
 * carried the SUBJECT's facts inside the window. It answers "when did we last
 * hear from that source at all", which is the collection clock the prototype's
 * copy names ("Provider coverage is 26 h old against a 12 h threshold").
 * Windowing the clock would make every historical month refuse forever, which
 * says nothing about whether the data is current — so RELEVANCE is windowed and
 * subject-scoped while the CLOCK behind it is neither. Sources are pulled
 * independently (one per org / enterprise / connector), so a per-PROVIDER
 * estate-wide MAX let an unrelated organisation's recent pull vouch for a
 * subject's own stale source (r3-M3).
 *
 * A fresh Anthropic clock must NOT mask a stale Copilot one, so the endpoint
 * refuses when ANY relevant provider is past the threshold — and a relevant
 * provider we have NEVER observed is treated as stale, not as fresh: fail-closed
 * is the only honest reading of "we cannot establish how old this is".
 *
 * LANE: `provider_usage_fact` only. `actual_spend`'s own refresh marker would be
 * the other candidate operand and is unreachable from here BY DESIGN — the lane
 * firewall bans raw `actual_spend` in every reporting read path
 * (tests/unit/server/reports-lane-firewall.test.ts). `provider_usage_fact` is
 * written by the same transform on the same run, so it carries the same clock.
