/*
 * copilot-overage-allocation — compute + persist the per-cost-owning-unit
 * distribution of one (enterprise, month)'s PAID pooled Copilot overage
 * (ADR-0011 D10, design §5.4). `copilot_pool_bill.overage_net_usd` is the
 * bill-anchored source of record (read straight off the enterprise billing
 * usage report by server/workers/copilot-pool-bill.ts) — this module NEVER
 * changes that figure. It only DISTRIBUTES it: every policy conserves
 * `Σ allocated_usd == overage_net_usd` exactly, asserted by a read-back after
 * persistence, never merely in memory.
 *
 * GRAIN: (provider_enterprise_id, month, cost_owning_unit_id) — "recipient" is
 * the seat-holder's cost-owning unit (D10: "user weights summed to the
 * seat-holder's cost-owning unit"), NOT the org the seat happens to be
 * licensed under. This is the entire point of the mechanism: a single shared
 * GitHub org's overage can now be split across every practice/CoU that
 * actually consumed, rather than landing wholesale on the one CoU the org's
 * `provider_org.cost_owning_unit_id` happens to map to (the coarser, existing
 * org-homed figure `v_finance_copilot_pool_chargeback` falls back to when no
 * allocation has been computed yet — see the migration rewriting that view).
 *
 * LOCKING + THE MONTH'S SNAPSHOT (design §8.4): every persist call acquires the
 * `reportingSnapshot` advisory lock (keyed on the month) THEN the
 * `copilotOverageAllocation` lock (keyed on `${enterpriseId}:${month}`) —
 * the SAME lock the copilot-pool-bill worker's bill rewrite takes — before
 * touching any row, so a concurrent snapshot close or bill refresh can never
 * race a write here. A month that has been CLOSED is not special: the provider
 * is the record of truth, its corrected bill lands, and the difference against
 * that month's snapshot surfaces as a delta.
 *
 * WEIGHT SOURCES (never actual_spend's copilot rows — v_teammate_usage_daily
 * itself excludes those in favour of reconciliation_record for exactly this
 * reason, mig 0101 PART 3):
 *   - consumption-share / excess-share / excess-equal: per-teammate Copilot
 *     USAGE for the month, from `reconciliation_record` (scope='teammate',
 *     provider='github') — the same gross source v_teammate_usage_daily's
 *     copilot branch reads (mig 0038/0086), so the weight is the same number
 *     already shown to users as "usage". Governance-filtered so an
 *     exempt/tracked org's usage never dilutes or claims a chargeable share.
 *   - seat-share: the roster of ACTIVE SEATS this month, from
 *     `actual_spend` WHERE category='seat-license' (copilot-bill.ts's
 *     whole-month showback row — written for EVERY seat regardless of usage,
 *     which is exactly the roster seat-share needs and reconciliation_record,
 *     usage-driven, cannot provide).
