/**
 * Transaction-scoped advisory locks, namespaced and totally ordered.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Both provisioning paths (`server/auth/emit-provision.ts`,
 * `server/auth/enroll-provision.ts`) serialise several different things inside
 * one transaction: a per-device dedup key, a per-principal cap, and a global
 * cap. Written ad hoc they took the SINGLE-argument
 * `pg_advisory_xact_lock(hashtext(...))`, which has two defects that only show
 * up under concurrency:
 *
 * 1. **One flat key space.** `hashtext` returns int4, so an instance id's hash
 *    can equal an unrelated teammate id's hash. Two transactions acquiring
 *    (instance, teammate) whose hashes are swapped acquire the SAME two locks
 *    in OPPOSITE order, which is a textbook deadlock. The old comment dismissed
 *    collisions as "only ever over-serializes unrelated callers — harmless",
 *    which is true of a collision WITHIN one key space and false across two.
 *
 * 2. **No stated order.** Nothing forced the paths to agree on acquisition
 *    order, so adding a third lock was a deadlock risk each time.
 *
 * The two-argument form `pg_advisory_xact_lock(classid, objid)` gives each
 * concern its own 32-bit space, so an instance key can never collide with a
 * teammate key no matter what `hashtext` returns. `LOCK_NAMESPACE` values are
 * the total order: acquire ascending, always. Within one namespace, collisions
 * remain harmless over-serialisation, which is the property the original
 * comment was reaching for.
 *
 * All locks are `_xact_` — released at COMMIT or ROLLBACK, never leaked.
 *
 * WHAT THIS MODULE DOES **NOT** COVER, and why. Postgres treats the one-argument
 * `pg_advisory_xact_lock(bigint)` and the two-argument `(int, int)` form as two
 * DISJOINT lock spaces: a key in one never excludes a key in the other. Three
 * call sites still take the single-argument form and are deliberately left there:
 *
 *   - `server/auth/emit-provision.ts` → `issueInstanceEmitCredentialTx`, keyed on
 *     the instance id. It serialises the credential rotate→issue→bind sequence.
 *   - `server/utils/tag-session.ts`, `server/utils/worklist-bulk.ts` — unrelated
 *     concerns that never interleave with provisioning.
 *
 * Moving the first of those into the `instance` namespace would be tidier and is
 * NOT worth it: during a rolling deploy old and new replicas would hold keys in
 * the two different spaces and stop excluding each other, reopening the exact
 * rotate/insert TOCTOU window that lock exists to close, for as long as the
 * rollout takes. A cosmetic consistency win is not worth a real (if brief) window
 * on credential rotation. Migrating it needs its own change, with the two-phase
 * "take both keys, then drop the old one" dance a lock-space move requires.
 *
 * So the ordering contract below governs the locks in THIS module, and the
 * credential lock sits outside it. That is safe today because it is acquired
 * LAST on every path that takes both (enrol: instance → principal → globalCap →
 * credential; redeem takes only the credential lock), so no cycle exists. A new
 * path that takes the credential lock BEFORE any namespaced one would create
 * one — put it last, or do the migration properly.
