/*
 * placeTeammate — THE write that moves one teammate to a cost centre.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS. There are now two surfaces that place people: the per-row
 * select on /admin/users (PATCH /admin/users/:id/org-unit) and the bulk action
 * on the region worklist (POST /admin/users/bulk-place). They must not each
 * decide who is allowed to move whom — a second copy of the region rule is how
 * a cross-region placement gets through one door while the other holds. So the
 * authorisation, the region containment, the provenance strip and the audit row
 * live HERE, once, and both handlers call this.
 *
 * THE AUTHORISATION IS NOT PARAMETERISED, deliberately. Every caller gets:
 *   1. the teammate must exist (404);
 *   2. `requireRegionScope` against the TEAMMATE's region — a region admin
 *      cannot move another region's person;
 *   3. the target unit must be ACTIVE and in the TEAMMATE's OWN region (422).
 * (2)+(3) compose into the property the bulk endpoint needs and that neither
 * check gives alone: the target unit is in a region the caller administers.
 * There is no flag that relaxes any of it.
 *
 * WHAT *IS* PARAMETERISED is `targetPolicy`, and it is a PRODUCT rule, not a
 * safety control:
 *
 *   'any-active-unit'   — the /admin/users per-row move. Any active unit in the
 *                         region is a legal destination. This is the existing,
 *                         pinned contract (tests/integration/admin/
 *                         region-lifecycle.test.ts §7 moves a teammate onto a
 *                         plain `team` node and asserts 200) and it is not
 *                         narrowed here.
 *   'cost-owning-only'  — the bulk PLACE action. Its whole purpose is to make
 *                         spend reach a cost centre, so it refuses a target that
 *                         is not itself cost-owning. That also refuses the
 *                         `__UNPLACED__` holding node for free (holding nodes are
 *                         created is_cost_owning_unit = false), which is the one
 *                         destination that would look like progress and be none.
 *
 * The narrower policy is strictly SAFER, never laxer, so the two doors cannot
 * disagree about who may act — only about which destinations the action offers.
 *
 * ── THE CHECKS RUN UNDER LOCKS, because otherwise they are advisory ───────
 * Every one of those checks reads a row that another transaction can change
 * before this one's UPDATE lands, and READ COMMITTED gives each statement its own
 * snapshot. Unlocked, both of these are real:
 *   - a concurrent region PATCH moves the teammate to another region AFTER
 *     requireRegionScope passed against the old one → the UPDATE completes and a
 *     region admin has placed a person who is no longer theirs, with none of the
 *     revoke cascade that a cross-region move owes;
 *   - a concurrent retire (or a cost-owning un-tick) lands on the destination
 *     AFTER it validated as an active cost-owning unit → the teammate is placed
 *     into a retired bucket.
 * So the teammate row is taken FOR UPDATE and the destination unit FOR SHARE
 * before anything is validated, and both are held to commit.
 *
 * The destination is FOR SHARE rather than FOR UPDATE deliberately. We are not
 * modifying it — we require only that it cannot be retired or un-flagged under
 * us, which is exactly what a share lock buys, and share locks are mutually
 * compatible. An exclusive lock would make two bulk batches aiming at the SAME
 * cost centre serialise on it, and — because a batch holds every lock it has
 * taken until the outer transaction commits — two batches placing overlapping
 * ids in different orders would DEADLOCK. A share lock still blocks the retire.
