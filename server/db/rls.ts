/*
 * RLS context helper — sets the four session GUCs that the RLS policies
 * read at every query.
 *
 * Per data-model.md §RLS, app code MUST set these on every connection
 * checkout. Calling `withRlsContext` wraps a callback in a transaction
 * where the GUCs are scoped (SET LOCAL); after the callback returns the
 * settings are gone, so the next checkout doesn't inherit them.
 *
 * Epic 3 wires this into the Nitro request lifecycle. Tests use this
 * directly to exercise the policies.
 *
 * Three lanes carry an identity onto a connection (docs/design/rls-enforcement.md
 * §2), and all three land here:
 *   - request  → server/db/request-rls.ts::withRequestRls (the cookie session)
 *   - machine  → server/db/machine-rls.ts::withMachineRls (a presented credential)
 *   - worker   → a dedicated pool carrying a connection-level GUC (not this file)
