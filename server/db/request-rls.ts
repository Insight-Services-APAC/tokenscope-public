/*
 * withRequestRls — bind the current request's session to a transaction
 * with the four RLS GUCs set, then run a body inside it.
 *
 * Pattern: every API handler that hits user-scoped data wraps the DB
 * call in withRequestRls(event, async (tx) => ...). The transaction
 * uses SET LOCAL so the GUCs are gone the moment the body returns.
 *
 * For pre-Epic-4 endpoints that don't yet have a real Nitro event (e.g.
 * tests, workers), use server/db/rls.ts::withRlsContext directly.
