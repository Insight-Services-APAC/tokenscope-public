/**
 * A HOLDING node must never be cost-owning.
 *
 * WHY THE RULE EXISTS. The Unplaced row is where an admin lands when they notice
 * "290 teammates, region known, cost centre unknown", and Edit → "Cost-owning
 * unit" was the only control on that screen that moved the number. Ticking it
 * moves it to ZERO: the chargeback view homes spend on the nearest cost-owning
 * ANCESTOR, so the holding node would instantly become 290 people's cost centre.
 * Every unhomed dollar would report as homed, to a bucket nobody owns and no P&L
 * answers for, and nothing would have been fixed. That is worse than the defect —
 * a silent, plausible zero.
 *
 * WHAT ENFORCES IT, AND WHERE — precisely, because "must never" used to be a
 * claim about a helper that two HTTP handlers happened to call, which left raw
 * SQL, migrations, seeds and future workers unrestricted:
 *
 *   STRUCTURAL   `org_unit_holding_never_cost_owning`, a CHECK constraint
 *                (drizzle/migrations/0110_holding_node_never_cost_owning.sql).
 *                Every writer is bound by it, including ones that never call
 *                this function. That is the guarantee.
 *   API          this function, on both write doors (POST /admin/org-units and
 *                PATCH /admin/org-units/:id). It is NOT the guarantee — it is
 *                the legible sentence an admin needs, which a constraint
 *                violation cannot give them.
 *
 * Keyed on `unit_type`, the classification key
 * (shared/placement/holding-nodes.ts), so a second holding node minted under a
 * different code is covered by the same rule. The constraint keys on the same
 * value.

/**
 * An existing HOLDING node's `unit_type` is not a user-editable property.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS SEPARATE FROM THE RULE ABOVE. The cost-owning guard is evaluated
 * against the EFFECTIVE row a PATCH would produce, which is right for a body
 * that only sets the flag — and is exactly the bypass when the body sets BOTH:
 * `{ unit_type: 'team', is_cost_owning_unit: true }` on the holding node
 * produces an effective row that is no longer a holding node, so the guard waves
 * it through. Everyone stays on the node while it becomes a cost centre, which is
 * the precise outcome the guard exists to prevent — reached by relabelling rather
 * than by ticking the box. The two-step (retype, then enable) is the same bypass
 * spread over two requests, and this refusal kills both, because it is the first
 * step that both need.
 *
 * The reverse direction is deliberately NOT refused: turning a plain unit INTO a
 * holding node is a legitimate (if unusual) admin action, and the cost-owning
 * rule still binds the result.
 *
 * API-ONLY, and the constraint in mig 0110 does not extend to it: raw SQL can
 * still retype a holding node and then flip the flag. Say so rather than imply a
 * structural guarantee that is not there.
