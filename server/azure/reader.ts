/*
 * Telemetry reader — pulls a session's token usage from the telemetry

 *
 * Claude Code emits token usage as OTel METRICS + LOG EVENTS (not spans);
 * the `api_request` event carries the four token counts + cost per API
 * call. Our injected OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES.tokenscope.instance_id rides
 * every record, so the join key is OURS (== instance_attestation.instance_id),

 * docs/development/claude-code-telemetry-contract.md.
 *
 * Two implementations behind one interface:
 *   - LocalCollectorReader — local spike: queries the collector-fed
 *     telemetry store (tools/fake-azure-monitor), which has normalised
 *     Claude's OTLP into UsageRecords keyed on tokenscope.instance_id.
 *   - LogAnalyticsReader — sandbox (Path B): queries Log Analytics via
 *     @azure/monitor-query KQL. Implemented at the Epic-10 sandbox cut.
 * Selected by NUXT_TELEMETRY_READER (default 'local').

 * ── NATIVE GitHub Copilot OTel (GenAI semantic conventions) — read-side ──────
 *
 * GitHub shipped enterprise-managed OTLP export for Copilot Chat (VS Code) +
 * Copilot CLI (2026-07-08). It emits GenAI-semantic-convention telemetry
 * (gen_ai.usage.*, gen_ai.request.model) natively — no client forwarder,
 * transcoder, or bearer shim. The renewed design (docs/decisions/
 * 0009-...-addendum) is: native managed OTLP → Azure LAW ingestion DIRECTLY,
 * joined on OUR injected `tokenscope.instance_id` resource attribute (the SAME
 * key Claude uses), so one instance's Claude + Copilot usage unify through the
 * existing joiner + attribution_record — no new identity primitive.
 *
 * This is the READ-SIDE only, gated OFF by default (NUXT_COPILOT_NATIVE_OTEL).
 * It is DORMANT until the durable-auth + landing-shape spike (SPK-COPILOT-OTEL,
 * docs/build/copilot-native-otel-spike.md) confirms the two live-gated
 * assumptions marked SPIKE-CONFIRM below. Nothing here touches the live path.
 *
 * §A/§B: this is USAGE (§A) — tokens + model. Native GenAI carries NO AI
 * credits (nano_aiu) and no authoritative $, so cost stays §B (the pooled
 * bill). These rows carry tokens only; costing is deliberately unchanged.
 */

// the KQL projection and the tests. `reasoning.output_tokens` is DELIBERATELY
// absent: per the GenAI convention it is a SUBSET of output_tokens (the
// "thinking" portion), so emitting it as a separate row would double-count.
// SPIKE-CONFIRM: whether cache_read is a subset of input_tokens (double-count
// risk) — modelled 1:1 here, mirroring Claude's proven 4-count api_request
// shape; confirm against live Copilot→LAW data before enabling.
