       * row actually moved. A false here is a SKIP, never a move.
       *
       * ORDER OF LOCKS, and why the plain conditional UPDATE is not enough on its own.
       * A no-key UPDATE takes FOR NO KEY UPDATE, which does NOT conflict with the
       * FOR KEY SHARE an instance_attestation / oauth_token INSERT takes on its parent
       * teammate row — so a concurrent credential insert neither blocks nor is seen.
       * The explicit `FOR UPDATE` does conflict with it: an insert already in flight
       * makes us wait and is then visible to the UPDATE's own (fresh, READ COMMITTED)
       * snapshot, and one starting after us waits for our commit. The destination is
