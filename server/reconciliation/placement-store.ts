 *   - bill teammates get an `entra_oid='bill:'||uuid` placeholder, source='bill',
 *     non-provisional (so the money path's `NOT provisional` filter accepts them);
 *   - region_id is NEVER set by us — the mig-0066 trigger derives it from

       * legal is re-readable and re-writable during those awaits:
       *
       *   - the SAFETY predicate. `rehomeSafePredicate` is the control that keeps an
       *     automatic lane off anyone with a live session to re-scope. Evaluated only
       *     as a candidate filter, an emit instance or an OAuth token created during
       *     the awaits is re-scoped with no revoke cascade — precisely what the
       *     predicate exists to prevent.
       *   - the DESTINATION. It can be retired, un-flagged as cost-owning, or moved to
       *     another region in the same window, so "an active cost-owning unit in this
       *     region" is a fact about the preview, not about the write.
       *
       * So both are conditions of the UPDATE itself, and RETURNING reports whether the
       * row actually moved. A false here is a SKIP, never a move.
       *
       * ORDER OF LOCKS, and why the plain conditional UPDATE is not enough on its own.
       * A no-key UPDATE takes FOR NO KEY UPDATE, which does NOT conflict with the
       * FOR KEY SHARE an instance_attestation / oauth_token INSERT takes on its parent
       * teammate row — so a concurrent credential insert neither blocks nor is seen.
       * The explicit `FOR UPDATE` does conflict with it: an insert already in flight
       * makes us wait and is then visible to the UPDATE's own (fresh, READ COMMITTED)
       * snapshot, and one starting after us waits for our commit. The destination is
       * pinned FOR SHARE second — the same lock, in the same order, as
       * server/db/place-teammate.ts, so the two placement writers cannot deadlock
       * against each other.
       *
       * Wrapped in its own transaction so the lock and the write are atomic on a
       * worker's pooled handle too; inside the endpoint's request transaction this is
       * a savepoint, and the locks are held to the outer commit either way.
