/*
 * region-reresolve — apply the CURRENT placement configuration to the people who
 * already exist, scoped to ONE region, with a preview.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS. Adding a cost-centre owner, or a unit rule, changes what the
 * derivation WOULD decide — and nothing re-decides it. `region-reenrichment` does
 * re-derive, but it is a global cron worker reachable only from /admin/workers, a
 * platform-admin surface, so the region admin who just changed the configuration
 * cannot apply it. This is that same derivation, made callable from the region
 * page where the change was made.
 *
 * IT IS NOT A SECOND PLACEMENT ENGINE. The candidate safety predicate is
 * rehome-safety.ts (shared with the worker and the bill lane), the derivation is
 * region-derivation.ts's `derivePlacement` (shared with both workers), and the
 * writes are the same PlacementStore methods. What this module owns is the SCOPE
 * and the PREVIEW.
 *
 * ── THE TARGET POLICY IS DELIBERATELY NARROWER THAN THE WORKER'S ──────────────
 * The cron worker may re-home someone into another region's holding node, and may
 * DE-PLACE a stale unit placement to the global bucket. A region admin's action
 * may do neither. It only ever moves a teammate ONTO a cost-owning unit IN THE
 * REGION IT WAS INVOKED FOR. Three consequences, all intentional:
 *
 *   - It can never eject a teammate from the region the caller administers, which
 *     is the same line `POST /admin/users/bulk-place` holds: a cross-region move
 *     owes the revoke cascade, and that is the region PATCH's job.
 *   - A teammate whose chain resolves into ANOTHER region is reported as
 *     `outOfRegion` and left alone, rather than moved by a caller with no
 *     authority over the destination.
 *   - There is no path here that writes the GLOBAL holding bucket, so a
 *     derivation that comes back empty is always "no change", never a
 *     de-placement. Under FORCE RLS a region admin cannot read another region's
 *     owners at all, so an empty derivation would otherwise have meant "I cannot
 *     see your owner, so I will take your placement away".
 *
 * ── THE SAFETY PREDICATE IS NOT RELAXED ──────────────────────────────────────
 * Same `rehomeSafePredicate` as the worker: never-adopted `bill:` placeholders
 * with no live emit instance and no live OAuth token. A teammate with a live
 * session would need the revoke cascade, and this action does not run one.
 *
 * ── THE ORDERING TRAP ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Re-resolving re-derives against CURRENT configuration. If no unit route exists
 * yet, every candidate derives back to exactly where they are and the admin
 * concludes the feature is broken. So the run FIRST asks whether any unit route
 * is viable — an unambiguous cost-centre owner, or a unit rule pointing into this
 * region — and if none is, it returns that verdict WITHOUT walking a single
 * manager chain. Saying "fix the configuration first" is cheaper and more useful
 * than proving it one Graph call at a time.
 *
 * The viability verdict is computed from the SAME loaded maps the derivation will
 * use (and the walk's own `resolvesToSingleUnit` predicate), never from a second
 * query describing the same thing — so it cannot promise a route the run then
 * fails to take.
 *
 * ── A PASS ADVANCES, IT DOES NOT RE-READ ─────────────────────────────────────
 * Candidates come oldest-`last_sync_at`-first, so the cursor only moves if the
 * pass STAMPS what it looked at. A committing pass therefore stamps every row it
 * considered — moved or not — because the rows it did NOT move (unresolved,
 * errored, out-of-region, already correct) are exactly the ones that would
 * otherwise pin themselves to the head of the ordering and starve the tail while
 * `remaining` kept asking for another pass.
 *
 * ── THE DECISION IS RE-ASSERTED AT WRITE TIME ────────────────────────────────
 * Choosing a candidate and writing it are separated by a directory lookup and a
 * manager-chain walk. The safety predicate, the teammate's region and the
 * destination's validity are all writable by someone else in that window, so the
 * final UPDATE carries them as conditions and reports whether it fired
 * (`homeTeammateIfStillDerivable`). A row that did not move is `skipped`, never
 * `moved`.
