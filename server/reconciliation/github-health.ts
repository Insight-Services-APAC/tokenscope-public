/*
 * GitHub Copilot reconciliation health — the engine behind the admin GitHub health
 * route (server/api/v1/admin/reconciliation/github/health.get.ts). The GitHub twin of
 * server/anthropic/org-health.ts: a live, classified, KEY-SAFE probe that tells an admin
 * exactly WHERE a Copilot enterprise's reconciliation pipeline breaks — egress vs auth vs
 * metrics-empty vs no-teammate-match — because the worker logs are NSP-locked (inaccessible).
 *
 * The probe decomposes the pipeline into STAGES, each caught + classified independently:
 *   credential → roster → (App mode) appAuth → licenses → metrics → verdict.
 *
 * SAFETY CONTRACT (non-negotiable, mirrors org-health.ts):
 *   This module NEVER returns or logs the App private key, the decoded PEM, the App JWT,
 *   an installation token, the PAT, or any raw provider error body. It returns only:
 *     - booleans + counts (licenseCount, recordCount, rosterMatched, matchedRecords),
 *     - reasons/verdicts drawn from a FIXED enum vocabulary.
 *   NOTE on the client's error detail: for most surfaces data.detail is just
 *   "<surface> returned HTTP <status>", but the users-1-day surface APPENDS a ≤200-char
 *   sanitized BODY SNIPPET (github-client.ts getUserDailyCredits). classifyGithubHealthError
 *   therefore only ever pattern-MATCHES detail and RETURNS enum values — it never copies
 *   detail (or any error text) into the result, so a body snippet can never reach the
 *   response.
 *
 * Client-INJECTABLE (probeClient factory) + roster-INJECTABLE so the whole ladder unit-tests
 * with mocks (no network, no DB). Both default to the real client + shared roster reader.

 *      body snippet). We PATTERN-MATCH the detail and read the status out of it — the SAME
 *      technique discover-orgs.post uses — but never copy detail into the result.
 *   2. resilientFetch re-throws a raw transport error on a network-layer failure: a node
 *      error carrying `.code` (ECONNREFUSED/ETIMEDOUT/EAI_AGAIN/…), a getaddrinfo/TLS/socket
 *      message, or — under the probe's tight per-attempt budget — the AbortSignal.timeout
 *      DOMException (name 'TimeoutError'). Those are the egress signatures.
 *   3. res.json()/Zod parse throws (GitHub answered with an HTML error page or a drifted
 *      shape) — a SyntaxError / ZodError. Transient upstream, NOT an egress verdict.
 *   4. the probe's own stage-deadline backstop sentinel (code PROBE_WINDOW_EXCEEDED) —
 *      transient (probe-window-exceeded), never an egress claim.
 *
 * Order matters:
 *   a. fail-loud config errors (missing App key / malformed PEM) — exact types/prefixes;
 *   b. the probe's own stage-deadline BACKSTOP sentinel (code PROBE_WINDOW_EXCEEDED) —
 *      distinct from egress: with the tight per-attempt fetch budget a REAL black hole
 *      surfaces as a genuine transport timeout well before the backstop, so a backstop hit
 *      means pathological slowness, not proven egress (round-2 NEW-M1);
 *   c. parse errors (SyntaxError/ZodError) BEFORE the egress regex — their messages carry
 *      arbitrary response-derived text that must never accidentally match an egress signature;
 *   d. the client's LITERAL "report not ready" / "report_day … != requested" fail surfaces
 *      BEFORE the status parse — they carry "HTTP 200" (github-client.ts), which no status
 *      bucket must swallow into a false red (M1);
 *   e. egress signatures — node error codes/messages AND the AbortSignal.timeout abort
 *      (undici rejects with a DOMException named 'TimeoutError'; a plain abort is
 *      'AbortError'). Genuine transport-level failures ONLY, never an HTTP response;
 *   f. the REAL upstream status parsed from detail — the client wraps EVERYTHING in a 502
 *      createError envelope (data.status=502), so detail's "HTTP <n>" is authoritative and
 *      data.status only the fallback. 404 is MODE-AWARE (M2): in App mode it means the App
 *      isn't installed; in PAT mode GitHub 404s PATs lacking scope/SSO → auth-failed;
