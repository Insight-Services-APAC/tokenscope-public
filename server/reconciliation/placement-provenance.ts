/*
 * placement-provenance — the vocabulary for "this home was DERIVED, and here is
 * what derived it", as one module rather than a string literal per call site.
 *
 * WHY IT MATTERS. `teammate.metadata.placedVia` is not decoration: it is the flag
 * that decides whether a later pass may re-derive someone. A derived placement
 * (manager chain, or a curated attribute rule) is a standing inference and must
 * follow the configuration when the configuration changes — that is exactly what
 * spec C7's "Re-resolve placement" applies. An ADMIN placement is an assertion
 * and must NOT be re-derived, which is why server/db/place-teammate.ts strips
 * these keys on every manual move.
 *
 * So the set of derived kinds is the re-resolve candidate set, and the key list
 * is what a manual placement must clear. Both were previously spelled out as
 * literals in four files; adding the mig-0112 rule kind to three of them and
 * missing the fourth would have left rule-placed teammates permanently frozen
 * (never re-derived) or admin placements silently re-derived away.
