/*
 * GitHub Copilot reconciliation adapter (Stream B).
 *
 * One instance is bound to one enterprise + its manage_billing PAT. It sweeps the
 * Copilot seat roster (the lane authority: login -> license-org), resolves each
 * login to a TokenScope teammate via the directory-seeded identity map, pulls
 * per-user `ai_credit/usage` for each UTC day in the window, and emits
 * provider-neutral `ReconciledLine[]` in the NATIVE credit unit. The engine prices
 * the OTel side credit-vs-credit (attribution_record.credit_qty) and books USD at
 * the authoritative grossAmount/grossQuantity rate. See docs/design/reconciliation-engine.md
 * §4.2, §4.3, §5.2, §7.1, §8.
 *
 * Identity is directory-sourced, never telemetry-trusted: the Copilot OTel span
 * carries only a salted `enduser.pseudo.id` and the *repo* org — neither is used
 * here (§4.3).
 *
 * Intent: ADR-0010. This adapter stages the METERED ai_credit usage into
 * reconciliation_record; the Copilot BILL (whole-month flat seat + per-user overage)
 * is computed from that staged usage + the seat roster by the copilot-bill writer
 * (server/workers/copilot-bill.ts) and written to actual_spend (the showback/chargeback
 * lane). A login with no identity link is SKIPPED here for THIS run's usage-staging — but
 * it is no longer lost: identity-sync now bill-driven-PROVISIONS that seat-holder
 * (github-identity.ts, ADR-0010 rule 1), so the next run maps + stages + bills them. The
 * old "carried forward, never dropped" wording was false (the seat's cost was dropped);
 * provisioning is what actually closes it.

 * usage/showback ("trust the developer"; Copilot is `indicative` today, out of chargeback), but
