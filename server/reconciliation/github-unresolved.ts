/*
 * Unresolved Copilot login discovery (identity-tail layer 3) — the engine behind the admin
 * "Unresolved Copilot users" surface (server/api/v1/admin/reconciliation/github/unresolved.get.ts).
 *
 * WHY A LIVE ROSTER READ, NOT A reconciliation_record QUERY:
 *   A github login with reconciled Copilot spend but NO teammate_identity_map row (either lane)
 *   is "unresolved". Such a login is NEVER persisted anywhere: the reconciliation adapter
 *   (github.ts pullPatBilling/pullAppMetrics) and both bill writers SKIP an unmapped login
 *   BEFORE writing reconciliation_record / actual_spend (`if (!teammateId) continue`). So the
 *   unresolved tail exists ONLY in the live provider roster — the SAME authoritative surface
 *   the reconciler and the health probe read (seats in PAT mode, the users-1-day metrics report
 *   in App mode). This module reads that roster, diffs it against teammate_identity_map (via the
 *   SAME resolveGithubRoster the reconciler uses — so "unresolved here" == "skipped there"), and
 *   returns the unmatched logins with the context the report carries.
 *
 * SAFETY: mirrors github-health.ts — this module NEVER returns or logs a PAT, App key, PEM,
 * installation token, or a raw provider error body. It returns only logins + numeric context.
 * The client + roster reader are INJECTABLE so the whole path unit-tests with mocks (no network,
 * no live GitHub). RBAC/audit live in the route + the map endpoint; this is a pure reader.

   * rather than unbounded because these are authenticated calls against a rate-limited API and
   * the enterprise credential is shared with the reconciler.

   * A whole-pass DEADLINE on top of both, because neither bounds TIME: a profile API that hangs
   * rather than fails would hold a list that is already complete and correct. When it expires
   * the rows decorated so far keep their hints and the rest render without, which is the same
