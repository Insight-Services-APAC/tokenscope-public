/*
 * reports/velocity — the SINGLE velocity definition for the reporting area
 * (reporting-consolidation D-Q7, docs/design/reporting-consolidation/
 * 02-owner-decisions.md; build-design §8 Q7). The governance dial
 * (`velocity.spike_threshold`, mig 0049) is THE definition. The old practice-page
 * `FLAG_MULT = 2` literal (a second, hard-coded threshold) is retired — Wave 6
 * deletes that page and its orphan `GET /rollups/practice/{ouId}/velocity` endpoint.
 * This module lands the canonical resolver the reporting endpoints call so there is
 * exactly one source of truth; it does NOT delete pages (that is Wave 6).
 *
 * The dial is a FRACTIONAL delta (platform default 0.25 = "25% over baseline"),
 * resolved most-specific-wins (region overrides platform), fail-loud on an absent
 * platform row — see server/utils/governance-settings.ts.
