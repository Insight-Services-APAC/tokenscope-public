/*
 * Heartbeat-coverage / quarantined-spend detector (MCP client backbone — design
 * doc §"Heartbeat-coverage / quarantined spend" + §"untrusted LAW channel").
 *
 * THE THREAT. The emit credential is the most broadly-readable secret in the
 * system: it lives in ~/.claude/settings.json on every dev box (and every CW
 * sharing that host). The emit channel is therefore UNTRUSTED / effectively
 * public-write — anyone with an emit token can write SPOOFED attribution_record
 * rows claiming a victim's instance_id / project / email. That telemetry lands
 * provisionally "assigned to you" until reconciliation against Anthropic actuals
 * confirms or WIPES it. (Accepted by design — there's no cheap per-record signing
 * for a broadly-distributed client; defense is revoke + detect + reconcile.)
 *
 * THE SIGNAL. Each successful /bearer mint stamps instance_attestation.last_bearer_at
 * — an AUTHENTICATED heartbeat: "the OWNER of instance X held a valid emit
 * credential at time T" (the /bearer caller must own the instanceId, which a
 * cross-instance spoofer cannot). ts_start is the first such proof. So an
 * instance's authenticated-live window is approximately
 *   [ts_start, last_bearer_at + GRACE].
 *
 * THE CHECK (per session, off the hot path). Group attribution_record by
 * conversation (COALESCE(claude_session_id, instance_id)) + instance_id; take the
 * session's [MIN(ts_event), MAX(ts_event)]. The session is COVERED/verified iff its
 * instance's authenticated-live window spans that range. Otherwise QUARANTINED
 * ("unverified spend") — the cross-instance-spoof signal: spend claiming an
 * instance with no covering heartbeat.
 *
 * GRACE. Legit spend is always within ~one bearer-TTL of a heartbeat (the client
 * refreshes ~every 29 min). We add a grace (~35 min, env-tunable) on BOTH ends so a
 * normal session whose last event lands just after the most recent /bearer stamp —
 * or whose first event lands a touch before ts_start due to clock skew — is NOT
 * false-positived. The grace must comfortably exceed the refresh cadence; 35 min
 * gives ~6 min of margin over 29.
 *
 * HISTORICAL-DATA GUARD. last_bearer_at only began being stamped at this feature's
 * rollout (mig 0030). An instance enrolled before then has last_bearer_at IS NULL
 * NOT because it was spoofed but because nothing ever stamped it. Quarantining that
 * retroactively would flag ALL historical spend. So we ONLY evaluate an instance
 * once it has a heartbeat: last_bearer_at IS NOT NULL. An instance with
 * last_bearer_at IS NULL is SKIPPED entirely (no signal yet) — never quarantined.
 * (A genuinely-spoofed victim instance that the real owner is actively using WILL
 * have a last_bearer_at from the owner's own /bearer mints, so the spoofed session —
 * whose events fall outside that window — still gets caught. A spoofer targeting an
 * instance that has NEVER minted a bearer produces no heartbeat to compare against;
 * that case is left to reconciliation, by design.)
 *
 * INFORMATIONAL ONLY — NEVER AUTO-REVOKE / AUTO-DELETE. Quarantine is the EARLY/UX
 * detection leg of revoke+detect+reconcile, surfacing "unverified spend" on the web
 * before reconciliation (which lags ~1h+). It does NOT touch credentials, instances,
 * or spend. Reconciliation against Anthropic actuals is the ONLY thing that wipes
 * non-reconciling spend. This worker only writes/clears session_quarantine rows.
 *
 * WHAT IT CATCHES / DOESN'T. Catches the cross-instance spoof (records claiming a
 * victim instance_id the spoofer can't mint a bearer for → no covering heartbeat).
 * Does NOT catch full emit-credential THEFT (the thief owns the instance, so its
 * /bearer mints heartbeat AS the victim) — that stays on revocation + reconciliation.
 *
 * Mirrors went-silent.ts / reconciliation-gap.ts for structure + registry wiring.
