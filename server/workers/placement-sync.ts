/*
 * placement-sync — drains the owed-bill placement queue (the out-of-band half of
 * bill-driven placement; design docs/design/org-tree-and-bill-driven-placement.md).
 *
 * The money pollers ENQUEUE unknown-email bills into pending_placement (no Graph in
 * the money loop). This worker, on its own cadence, takes each distinct unplaced
 * identity and provisions+places the teammate (Entra-enriched) + replays its owed
 * bills into actual_spend — so a user who never logs in / emits still lands in their
 * cost-centre report. Graph faults are isolated here, never touching the poll.
 *
 * GRAPH FAILURE IS NOT ABSENCE. The directory lookups are the STRICT variants: a
 * throttle, 5xx or timeout throws before anything is written, so the identity is
 * skipped this run (counted in `errors`, its bills stay queued) — never provisioned
 * onto the global bucket as a "directory miss".
 *
 * DEADLINE. No new identity is started after PLACEMENT_SYNC_BUDGET_MS, and every
 * directory lookup carries the same deadline (the shared token mint has its own
 * fixed bound, ~21 s), so a throttle burst cannot hold the run
 * (and its single-flight lock) for hours. An identity not reached keeps its bills
 * unplaced, which is exactly what the selection below reads: the next run picks it
 * up, oldest-first, behind nothing newer.
