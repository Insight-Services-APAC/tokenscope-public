/*
 * reconciliation-sync worker — the hourly driver. Iterates every RECONCILED
 * credential-scope (Anthropic per-org, GitHub per-enterprise), instantiates that
 * provider's adapter (if registered), pulls normalised lines for [yesterday, today]
 * (idempotent re-pull), and runs the platform-agnostic engine.
 *
 * Phase 0: ADAPTER_FACTORIES is empty, so this is a clean no-op (scopesRun: 0) —
 * exactly like analytics-poll with zero reconciled orgs. It begins reconciling the
 * moment Stream A / Stream B registers a factory. See docs/design/reconciliation-engine.md.
