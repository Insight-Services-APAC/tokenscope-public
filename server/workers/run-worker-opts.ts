/*
 * Per-dispatch worker-options parsing for the internal run-worker endpoint
 * (server/api/v1/internal/run-worker/[name].post.ts). Extracted into its own
 * module (rather than living in the route file) so it is unit-testable without
 * booting Nitro and without any route-scanner ambiguity around named exports.
 *
 * The options ride the request BODY, which is inside the signed HMAC payload
 * (server/auth/internal-request.ts — the body-sha256 leg of the signed tuple),
 * so a caller cannot set these flags without a valid signature. No
 * signature-scheme change was needed to make the body a trusted input.
 *
 * Honoured options:
 *  - `deepRescan` (azure-monitor-read) — forces a full-window re-read to recover
 *    a read-path backlog after a silent outage. NOTE: "full window" means the
 *    reader's OUTER duration, which defaults to 7 days — pair it with
 *    `lookbackDays` to reach further back.
 *  - `lookbackDays` (azure-monitor-read) — widen the reader's outer scan bound
 *    beyond the 7-day default, up to 90 (the longest retention we provision).
 *    THE recovery lever for a backlog older than a week: the joiner dead-zone
 *    incident left weeks of already-ingested spend unjoined, and without this
 *    a signed re-run silently recovers only the last 7 days and reports success
 *    — indistinguishable from a full recovery. Costs query time proportional to
 *    the window, so use it for one-off recovery, not the cron.
 *  - `sessionIds` (azure-monitor-read) — scope a re-run to specific instance
 *    ids instead of the scheduled selection, so a recovery pass targets the
 *    affected instances rather than re-reading the whole fleet at a wide window.
 *  - `apply` (privileged-identity-cleanup) — the destructive-apply gate: without
 *    it the cleanup worker only REPORTS; with it (and only via this signed body,
 *    never the UI trigger) it may deactivate excluded teammates, under a hard cap.
 *  - `startingAt` / `endingAt` (analytics-poll) — override the default trailing
 *    30-day revision window with an explicit YYYY-MM-DD span. The operator lever
 *    for the #142 historical re-split: re-pulling a pre-split period rewrites its
 *    collapsed rows as per-surface lanes (the poller's stale-row prune converges
 *    the old collapsed rows). The Enterprise Analytics API holds data from
 *    2026-01-01, so that is the earliest useful startingAt.
 *    OPERATOR WARNING: without `externalOrgId` the override re-pulls the FULL
 *    window for EVERY reconciled org, serially, against the 60-RPM org-wide
 *    Enterprise API cap that reconciliation-sync shares — a multi-month
 *    all-orgs re-pull can run long and starve that worker's tick. Prefer
 *    scoping to one org per invocation.
 *  - `externalOrgId` (analytics-poll) — scope the poll (and therefore a window
 *    override) to ONE reconciled org's external id. Unknown id → clean no-op
 *    (orgsPolled 0), visible in the worker result.
 * Every other worker ignores these. The shape is deliberately generic/optional.

 * Max instances per WIDENED (lookbackDays) recovery run.

 * The bound is DATA VOLUME, not round-trip count — those are the same for a
 * 500-id run whatever the window, and the unwidened path (and the daily deep
 * tick) already do 500 serially. What a widened run multiplies is how much each
 * of those reads scans: 50 instances x 90 days = 4,500 instance-days, roughly
 * 1.3x the unattended daily deep pass (500 x 7d = 3,500). So a widened batch is
 * sized to cost about what the fleet already absorbs once a day, which the ~120s
 * worker gateway ceiling demonstrably tolerates. Unwidened scoped runs keep the
 * larger cap because they scan no more than a normal tick.
