/*
 * Session GC worker — closes abandoned sessions.
 *
 * Per api-and-connector-interfaces.md §1.3a: every 5 minutes, find rows
 * where `ts_actual_end IS NULL` AND `expires_at < NOW()`, set
 * `ts_actual_end = NOW()`, emit `audit_event` with `actor_system =
 * 'session-gc-worker'`.
 *
 * ABANDONED MEANS IDLE, NEVER OLD. `ts_expected_end` is the device's idle
 * window: every /bearer mint and every re-provision renews it, so a device in
 * use never reaches it. A device is closed only once BOTH that and its last
 * mint (or enrolment, if it never minted) plus the same window have passed. Both earlier cues
 * were ages and both closed working devices: `ts_start + 12h` (the 2026-06-06
 * attribution outage), then a `ts_expected_end` fixed at enrolment + 90d (every
 * device went red on its 90th day).
 *
 * Pure function: takes a Drizzle client + a "now" timestamp. Production
 * scheduling is BullMQ at Epic 10; the test calls runSessionGc() directly
 * with a synthetic now.
