/*
 * github-coverage-sweep — scheduled, bounded GitHub enterprise-org coverage detection
 * (Workstream D, design §6/§8.4: "so gaps are detected without an admin visit").
 *
 * For every registered GitHub provider_enterprise: compute LIVE coverage
 * (github-coverage.ts, App-mode only — a PAT enterprise short-circuits cheaply to
 * census-unavailable with no network calls), persist the result as the new latest
 * observation (coverage-store.ts), and — comparing against what was persisted BEFORE
 * this write — dispatch a DEDUPLICATED admin inbox alert exactly on a transition into a
 * non-connected state or a capability loss, auto-resolving when an org/enterprise
 * recovers. The PRIOR-vs-NEW comparison IS the dedup key: an org stuck in the same
 * non-connected state tick-over-tick never re-alerts; only a genuine change does.
 *
 * BOUNDED (requirement 5): per-enterprise work is bounded by
 * computeEnterpriseCoverage's own MAX_ORG_PROBES_PER_PASS + the census client's
 * pagination hard cap (github-coverage.ts / github-client.ts) — this worker adds no
 * further unbounded loop; the number of ENTERPRISES swept per tick is bounded by how
 * many are registered (an operator-controlled quantity, not attacker-controlled),
 * mirroring copilot-pool-bill.ts's per-tick enterprise loop.
 *
 * SECRETS NEVER LEAK: every value persisted/dispatched is a login, uuid, boolean,
 * count, or classified enum — computeEnterpriseCoverage already enforces this; this
 * worker adds no new secret-adjacent read.
