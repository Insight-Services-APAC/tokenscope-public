 * Worker registry — single source of truth mapping worker name to its

 * (scripts/run-worker.ts).
 *
 * To add a new worker:
 *   1. Implement and export `runFoo` in server/workers/foo.ts.
 *   2. Add `{ name: 'foo', run: runFoo }` to WORKERS below.
 *   3. Document the recommended cron cadence in the external scheduler

 *
 * Why a static registry instead of dynamic discovery: predictability.
 * The set of runnable worker names is auditable in one place, and the
