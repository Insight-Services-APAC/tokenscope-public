/*
 * Copilot flat-seat writer — SHOWBACK / DISPLAY-ONLY per-seat rows → actual_spend.
 *
 * SUPERSEDED FOR CHARGEBACK (reporting-consolidation Wave 0 / canonical §B): the Copilot
 * CHARGEBACK now comes from EXACTLY ONE surface — copilot_pool_bill (the POOLED bill net, read
 * by the copilot-pool-bill worker) — homed org→CoU. The per-seat rows this writer emits are
 * SHOWBACK / DISPLAY-ONLY: they are excluded from v_finance_bill_chargeback, from
 * v_finance_chargeback_month, and from the Σ=bill operand (test-enforced). The per-user OVERAGE
 * charge (`usage − $allowance`) that this writer used to emit was WRONG model #1
 * (docs/design/provider-billing-attribution-model.md §B) and has been REMOVED; the pooled
 * overage authority is copilot_pool_bill.overage_net_usd (read from the bill). The mig 0081
 * migration deletes the legacy source='copilot-overage' rows.
 *
 * What remains here: the whole-month flat per-seat rows (D1: a seat active any day owes the full
 * month), source='copilot-seat:<org>', tool='copilot-cli'. These are kept as a showback/display
 * signal only (a manager's "every dollar my people consume" view, rule 3); they are NOT a
 * chargeback figure and NEVER feed the pooled §B charge. Both dated the 1st of the month → a
 * re-run UPSERTS the same row (idempotent); each month gets its own set.
 *
 * NOTE (D-Showback): the owner decision REPLACES the per-seat showback rows with the §A-sanctioned
 * per-user usage display (the ai-credit usage lane, v_teammate_usage_daily copilot branch) in
 * user-facing lanes. This writer is retained for backward compatibility of the showback lane
 * until that display lands (Wave 5); its rows are firewalled out of every chargeback operand now.
 *
 * chargeback_exempt is still set from the license-org so NFR/exempt Copilot cost is shown in
 * showback (rule 3) but excluded from chargeback (rule 5) — the flag lives on the row; the
 * exclusion lives in the chargeback view. (Copilot is now excluded from chargeback wholesale by
 * tool anyway; the flag remains meaningful for the showback lane.)
 *
 * SEAT CONVERGENCE (S9): earlier versions only ever upserted rows for seats present in THIS
 * tick's roster and never deleted a row it did not re-assert — a seat removal, a login
 * rebind, or an org moving off the enterprise left the OLD showback row live forever (double
 * showback: the report/theme-5-duplicate-seat finding). runCopilotBillWriter now runs a
 * guarded stale-row prune after the seat loop, in the SAME successful run, scoped to this
 * enterprise's provider_org set (not just orgs seen this tick) — see the guard block below for
 * the three preconditions. It is a DELETE on a money table; every precondition exists because
 * an empty/short seats pull is NOT reliably an error signal (github-client.ts's
 * listSeatsWithDiagnostics).

   * missing/renaming the key, a short-page break, the 100-page hard cap). An
   * enterprise with genuinely zero seats is INDISTINGUISHABLE from an API-shape change
   * or a partial outage at this layer, so "no seats came back" must NEVER be read as
   * "no seats exist". A mechanical port of the Claude lane's guard alone
   * (`skipRatio = total > 0 ? skipped / total : 0`, prune when `<= 0.5`) prunes on
   * `total === 0` (ratio 0 <= 0.5) — deliberate there, WRONG here (see

   *
   *   1. seatsTotal > 0, EXPLICITLY — the guard the Claude lane does not need.
   *   2. seatsCarriedUnmapped / seatsTotal <= PRUNE_MAX_SKIP_RATIO — an outsized share
   *      of unmapped logins means identity resolution looks broken, not that the
   *      seats are gone.
   *   3. listSeats() throwing aborts BEFORE this point, unswallowed — a genuine pull
   *      failure never reaches the prune (there is no try/catch around the pull above).
   *
   * Scope is the ENTERPRISE'S org set from provider_org, not merely the orgs seen in
   * THIS run's roster — so an org that vanished from the roster ENTIRELY is still
   * covered, not only a rebind or an org-move within a roster that still lists it.
   *
   * KNOWN UNDER-DELETE (documented, not "fixed" here — the safe direction): a seat with
   * no resolvable license org writes source='copilot-seat:unknown' (see orgKey above),
   * which this provider_org-keyed filter never matches, so those rows are never pruned
   * by this pass. Widening the filter to a `LIKE 'copilot-seat:%'` was explicitly
   * rejected — that would delete a DIFFERENT enterprise's org rows sharing the same
   * `actual_spend` table. This lane does not fully converge; it converges everything
   * except the unresolved-org fallback.
   *
   * This is a DELETE on a money table: if any precondition doesn't hold, skip the
   * prune and log why — a stale showback row is recoverable, a deleted month is not.
