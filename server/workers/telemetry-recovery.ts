/*
 * telemetry-recovery worker — drains widened re-reads of already-ingested
 * telemetry, one instance-day at a time (mig 0093, 0148).
 *
 * Two kinds of request share the queue:
 *   - operator: an admin re-reads named instances at a wider lookback (up to 90
 *     days) to recover a backlog the 7-day window cannot reach;
 *   - scheduled: the daily 7-day pass over the joiner's own selection, which
 *     recovers telemetry the 5-minute watermark read missed (late arrivals,
 *     partial failures). This used to be azure-monitor-read's daily deep rescan,
 *     which held one instance's whole window in memory and the joiner's lock for
 *     ~40 minutes (docs/design/bounded-daily-deep-read.md).
 *
 * Each request is read as instance × day: day k of a lookback L requested at R
 * covers TimeGenerated in [R − (L−k)·24h, R − (L−k−1)·24h). The windows are fixed
 * by R, so resuming on a later tick leaves no gap, and each read holds at most
 * one instance's 24 h of events (a unit of work, not a heap cap). The cursor
 * (cursor_index, cursor_day) persists after each instance-day and the budget is
 * checked after each one, so every tick makes progress; each windowed query has
 * its own server timeout below the dispatch budget.
 *
 * A failed instance-day is counted in `errors` and the cursor moves on, as the
 * old daily rescan moved past a failed instance: the next daily pass re-reads
 * the same 7 days, so it is retried for all but the oldest day.
 *
 * Two pairings hold for every request: deepRescan (a widened read through the
 * watermark returns almost nothing while reading green) and an explicit instance
 * scope (a widened read of the whole fleet is a self-DoS). The joiner's write is
 * onConflictDoNothing on the dedup index, so overlapping with azure-monitor-read
 * is safe; each worker holds its own lock.
