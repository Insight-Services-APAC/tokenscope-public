 * Inbox dispatcher — routes each inbox-item category to the actor who can

 * dispatcher utility (route conflict / alert / action-request → right
 * recipient(s))" and journeys 1 / 4 / 5.
 *
 * The routing rule table is small and code-side rather than DB-side at
 * v1 per data-model.md §inbox_item ("Routing rules are implemented in
 * the notification dispatcher, not stored as a separate table").
 *
 * Each rule is pure: takes the dispatch input + the DB and returns the
 * recipient teammate id(s). Inserts are batched by the caller so callers
