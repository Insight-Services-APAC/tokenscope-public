/*
 * confirm-instance.ts — the confirm-on-auth merge (emit-on-install, slice 5).
 *
 * docs/design/emit-on-install-provisional-attribution.md §Flows 3 ("Confirm
 * identity") + §Safety properties. This is the ONLY path that promotes a
 * provisional instance to 'confirmed' and re-points it from its provisional
 * SHADOW teammate to the real, authenticated teammate.
 *
 * It is display-only — confirmation NEVER moves money (the finance gate is
 * anchored to the provider bill / `reconciled`, not to identity_state). What it
 * does is upgrade a person's pre-bill OTel usage from "provisional" to
 * "confirmed" for dashboard confidence, and fold the shadow teammate away.
 *
 * THE ANTI-LAUNDERING GATE (the whole point): a provisional instance can only be
 * confirmed by the genuine owner of the email it CLAIMED. The merge requires a
 * real human auth (requireAuth at the endpoint) AND an explicit accept, and here
 * it additionally requires `claimed_email == the authenticated teammate's email`
 * (normalized). This is what stops the laundering vector the review raised:
 *   - An attacker who enrolled a spoof claiming a coworker's email CANNOT confirm
 *     it — their own authenticated email won't match the claim → 403.
 *   - The real owner of that email is the only principal who CAN confirm it, and
 *     they do so EXPLICITLY after seeing the device in their list — so an
 *     unfamiliar device is rejected by a human, never auto-adopted. There is no
 *     email-match auto-merge and no aggregate-reconciliation merge anywhere.
 *
 * Cleanup choice (documented): the freed provisional shadow teammate is
 * MARK-REVOKED, not hard-deleted. Every provisional teammate is named as the
 * actor of its `instance-enrolled-provisional` audit row, and
 * audit_event.actor_teammate_id REFERENCES teammate(id) with NO cascade
 * (RESTRICT) — plus audit_event is append-only — so a DELETE would be refused by
 * the FK. We therefore retire the shadow (revoked_at/ended_at/is_active=false)
 * once it owns no more instances. Real (provisional=false) teammates are NEVER
 * touched.
 *
 * claimed_email choice (documented): on the confirmed row we NULL claimed_email
 * and stamp the verified identity onto principal_oid/principal_email (matching
 * the authenticated provision_emit shape, where claimed_email is NULL and
 * principal_email carries the verified email). The prior claimed_email + prior
 * shadow teammate id are preserved in the `instance-confirmed` audit payload for
 * dispute reconstruction.
