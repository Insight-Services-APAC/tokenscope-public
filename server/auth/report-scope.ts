/*
 * report-scope — the per-request enforcement layer for report ACCESS (mig 0129
 * replaces the three-mode admin dial, task #19). Resolves the caller's ACTIVE
 * `report_access_grant` permissions + cost-centre ownership, computes their
 * grants (shared/auth/report-visibility.ts), and gates the report scopes.
 *
 * The security boundary is NOT an import invariant — it is "every report-data
 * endpoint enforces effectiveReportGrants" (sg-M6/M8). This module is the shared
 * primitive those endpoints call:
 *   - resolveReportPermissions — this teammate's ACTIVE report_access_grant rows,
 *     one indexed query, memoised on the event, degrading to `[]` when the
 *     table is missing (upgrade/rollback safety — sg-L11), never throwing.
 *   - resolveReportGrants      — permissions + ACTIVE cost-centre ownership →
 *     grants. Used by the regional / cost-centre endpoints, which thread the
 *     grant into their EXISTING region clamps (the grant is a level, never a
 *     bypass).
 *   - costCentreScopeOpts      — the org-wide "ownership arm only" seal (A3 —
 *     see its own comment); server/reporting/cost-centres.ts's two resolvers
 *     thread it.
 *   - requireReportScope       — the hard 403 gate for the all-regions-required
 *     scopes (across + /reports/finance). It AUDITS every deny (sg-M4): those
 *     scopes have no in-query backstop, so the audit IS the forensic record.
