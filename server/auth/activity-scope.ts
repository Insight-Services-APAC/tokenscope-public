/*
 * requireActivityScope — the global-vs-region authz split for the activity-tag
 * vocabulary (activity_type). One decision point reused by the create / edit /
 * delete handlers so the rule can't drift between them.
 *
 * The vocabulary has two scopes:
 *   - GLOBAL  (region_id IS NULL) — the seeded standard set. Only the org-wide
 *     roles (global-finops / platform-admin) may mutate it. A region `admin` is
 *     bounded to their own region and must NOT edit the global vocabulary.
 *   - REGION  (region_id = a uuid) — a region's own additions. A region `admin`
 *     may mutate ONLY their own region (requireRegionScope); org-wide roles may
 *     act on any region.
 *
 * requireRole(event, 'admin', 'global-finops') must already have run upstream so
 * the caller is a known admin-class Session (platform-admin satisfies it via
 * isPlatformAdmin). This helper adds the scope gate on top.
 *
 * Why a dedicated helper rather than requireRegionScope alone: requireRegionScope
 * only blocks an `admin` whose regionId !== the target. For a GLOBAL entry the
 * target region is null, which requireRegionScope can't express — so the global
 * case needs an explicit "org-wide roles only" gate, kept here next to the
 * region case for a single, auditable rule.
