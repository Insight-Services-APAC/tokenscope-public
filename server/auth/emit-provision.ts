/*
 * Emit-provisioning orchestration (MCP client backbone — provision_emit + redeem).
 *
 * Two-step, secret-isolating device provisioning (docs/design/mcp-client-backbone.md
 * §"One auth → also provisions the device, WITHOUT a durable secret in the LLM"):
 *
 *   1. provision_emit (read-scoped MCP tool) → locateOrCreateInstance + mintEmitHandoff.
 *      Returns ONLY a short-TTL one-time HANDOFF code + redeem URL. The durable
 *      emit refresh token is NEVER minted here, so it can never enter the LLM's
 *      context (the broadly-readable emit credential is the most widely-exposed
 *      secret in the system — it must not transit the agent).
 *   2. redeem (direct process→server call, NOT MCP) → consumeEmitHandoff +
 *      issueEmitCredential. Returns the durable credential + the OTel bundle.
 *
 * Secrets discipline mirrors setup_token / oauth_auth_code: the handoff code is a
 * 32-byte random value; only its HMAC-SHA-256 hash is stored; single-use is an
 * atomic compare-and-swap on consumed_at (like consumeAuthCode), so a replayed or
 * concurrent redeem sees at most one success.
 *
 * The instance_attestation this creates is derived from the BEARER TEAMMATE (the
 * authenticated read identity), NOT a setup token — the teammate binding is the
 * unspoofable join key attribution requires. It is minted 'unassigned' (no
 * project): the device emits untagged and is tagged per-repo/per-session later.

 * Idempotency (docs §F2.3): if `instanceId` is supplied AND a LIVE attestation

 * provisioning the same device must NOT mint unbounded attestations. Otherwise
 * mint a fresh one (a supplied id NOT owned by this teammate is treated as absent:
 * we never adopt another teammate's instance, and we never leak that it exists).
 *
 * CROSS-ENVIRONMENT REUSE GUARD (mig 0060): an instance belongs to the deployment
 * environment that minted it (`deployment_env`, the NUXT_DEPLOY_ENV-classified
 * label). If a client re-provisions against a DIFFERENT deployment (Sandbox → Dev,
 * later Dev → Production) while still carrying the OLD environment's
 * tokenscope.instance_id, that id usually won't exist in the new DB at all and we'd
 * silently mint a duplicate. But if a row IS found and owned by this teammate yet
 * its stored deploy-env differs from this deployment's, we REJECT loudly (409)
 * rather than silently re-mint — a stale id pointed at the wrong environment is an
 * operator-visible error, not something to paper over. Legacy rows (deployment_env
 * NULL, pre-0060) are treated as same-env and back-filled on reuse.
 *
 * The attestation is 'unassigned' — provision_emit derives identity from the
 * bearer, which has no project. ts_expected_end tracks the durable emit
 * credential's life (90d) like setup/exchange (session-gc + /bearer gate on it).
 *
 * @param deployEnv this deployment's environment label, classified from
 *   NUXT_DEPLOY_ENV via the canonical currentServerDeployEnv() (the same resolver
 *   dev-login / admin-settings / obo use). Stable across a custom-domain cutover,
 *   unlike the public origin host (container-app.bicep:223: host is NOT the env
 *   signal, NUXT_DEPLOY_ENV is). Defaults to the running deployment's env — callers
 *   (e.g. tests) MAY override.
 * @param tx MUST be an open transaction. The advisory lock taken at the very
 *   top is pg_advisory_xact_lock (released at commit/rollback), and — because
 *   the create branch's INSERT now runs in the SAME transaction as the
 *   caller's downstream work (mcp.ts's provision_emit: handoff rotate, mint,
 *   audit) — a mid-sequence failure anywhere in that sequence rolls the
 *   INSERT back too. Previously this ran against a bare (autocommitting) db
 *   handle OUTSIDE the caller's transaction, so a downstream failure (e.g.
 *   the audit write) left a committed orphan instance_attestation with no
 *   handoff ever issued for it — a leak that compounds every time the cap
 *   below is exercised. Passing a non-transaction handle (as the
 *   cross-env-guard tests do, which never race and never fail
 *   mid-sequence) still works — pg_advisory_xact_lock is valid on any
 *   connection — it just loses the cross-statement locking guarantee.
 * @returns the instance_id to mint the handoff against and whether it was
 *   reused, OR CapExceeded when the CREATE branch would exceed the
 *   per-teammate or global live-instance cap (idempotent reuse never
 *   consumes quota — see below). The caller maps CapExceeded to a
