 * RLS is INERT at runtime (the app connects as the table owner, no FORCE ROW

 *                                        'global-finops' at the GUC layer by
 *                                        withRequestRls, so one clause covers both)
 *   - admin                           → their OWN region, never another
 *   - developer / manager             → their own org subtree (ltree <@)
 *
 * NOTE this deliberately does NOT copy allocation-scope's "admin is unbounded"
 * semantics: that predates the multi-region operating model. For a region-scoped
 * spend view, admin must be hard-bound to their region.

/**
 * The security clamp's LOAD-BEARING conjunction (S3): is the CALLER's own placement
 * (`app.user_org_path` within `app.user_region_id`) a genuine least-privilege home, or
 * the region-root catch-all whose subtree IS the whole region? Three candidate
 * discriminators, and why the answer is their CONJUNCTION rather than any one alone:
 *
 *   - `unit_type <> 'holding'` — catches only the `__UNPLACED__` node. Doesn't touch
 *     a region root that isn't a holding node (every seeded/created one today).
 *   - `code <> 'default'` — catches a SEEDED region's root, but `'default'` is a
 *     property of the seed files (drizzle/seed*.ts), NOT a schema invariant: BEFORE
 *     part (f), `regions.post.ts` creates a region with ZERO org units and
 *     `org-units.post.ts` does not reserve `'default'` — so a runtime-created region's
 *     root is whatever the admin typed, and this test FAILS OPEN the moment it isn't
 *     literally `'default'`. It also has a false positive `parent_id` doesn't: a
 *     legitimate NON-root unit that happens to be coded `'default'` (unique per
 *     `(region_id, code)`, so this can happen in another region) would blind a
 *     properly-placed teammate.
 *   - `parent_id IS NOT NULL` — catches a region root STRUCTURALLY, whatever it is
 *     named: a region root is by definition parentless. This is NOT the same test as
 *     `nlevel(path) = 1` — once an admin creates a root-level BU, that BU sits at a
 *     bare label OUTSIDE the seeded root's subtree, so `nlevel` and parentage diverge.
 *     Its own false positive: a legitimate admin-created ROOT-LEVEL BU (org-units.post
 *     explicitly allows `parent_id: null`) would blind a properly-placed manager.
 *
 * `code <> 'default'` alone carries the `parent_id`-class false positive PLUS a false
 * negative `parent_id` does not have (a runtime-created 'hq' root). On a security clamp
 * the false negative is strictly worse (it fails OPEN), so the clamp is keyed on the
 * STRUCTURAL test and keeps the naming test as defence-in-depth against the admin-root
 * false positive. Part (f) turns the naming test into a real invariant — every region's
 * root is ALWAYS the parentless `code='default'` unit and `'default'` can never be
 * anything else — so that arm's own false positive becomes unrepresentable.
 *
 * Do NOT key this on subtree coverage ("the placement spans every unit in the region")
 * either: an admin-created root-level BU sits at a bare label, so it is NOT `<@` the
 * seeded root — the seeded root stops spanning the region the instant one exists, so a
 * coverage test fails open in exactly the case that matters.
 *
 * Reads the SAME GUCs orgSubtreeScopePredicate does; NULLIF-guarded so an empty
 * `app.user_region_id` can't throw on the `::uuid` cast (the documented NULLIF trap).
