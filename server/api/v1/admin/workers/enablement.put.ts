/*
 * PUT /api/v1/admin/workers/enablement — turn a scheduled worker on or off.
 *
 * The write side of the admin kill-switch (mig 0090). Takes effect on the worker's
 * VERY NEXT tick — no deploy, no infra change. Every toggle is attributed
 * (updated_by/at) and audited.
 *
 * RBAC: requireRole(global-finops). NOT region-scoped `admin`, for the same reason
 * the RUN twin gives at [name]/run.post.ts:29-33 — `worker_enablement` has no region
 * column (mig 0090), and every worker it governs operates GLOBALLY, so a toggle
 * exceeds a region admin's scope. Disabling is the stronger case of the two: forcing
 * a run costs a sweep, whereas turning one off stops attribution, budget alerts or
 * spoof detection fleet-wide until someone notices. The read side (enablement.get)
 * stays open to `admin` — seeing the estate's kill-switch state is not a region
 * boundary crossing.
