/*
 * GET /api/v1/admin/reconciliation/github/health?enterpriseId=<uuid> — a LIVE,
 * classified, KEY-SAFE health/verify probe for ONE GitHub Copilot enterprise. The
 * GitHub twin of the Anthropic health route.
 *
 * GOAL: an admin clicks "Verify" and sees exactly WHERE this enterprise's reconciliation
 * pipeline breaks — egress vs auth vs metrics-empty vs no-teammate-match — because the
 * worker logs are NSP-locked (inaccessible). The verdict/color + per-stage lines make the
 * break point legible without any log access.
 *
 * SAFETY: never throws for a probe failure (computeGithubEnterpriseHealth catches +
 * classifies every stage), never returns/logs the App key, PEM, installation token, PAT,
 * or a raw provider error body. RBAC: requireRole(admin, global-finops) — same guard as the
 * enterprises reader. No assertSameOrigin: this is a GET (read-only probe), not a mutation,
 * matching the Anthropic health route's convention.
 *
 * NO RLS LANE, tracked as an explicit residue in scripts/check-handler-rls-context.mjs.
 * Unlike its Anthropic sibling — where the config read and the probe are separable, so the
 * read moved into the request lane — `computeGithubEnterpriseHealth` INTERLEAVES DB reads
 * with GitHub HTTP calls across the whole Verify ladder. Wrapping it in `withRequestRls`
 * would hold a request transaction open across third-party HTTP, which
 * docs/design/rls-enforcement.md §2 names as the failure mode (citing
 * copilot-bill-repull.post.ts, "that is the failure mode, not the precedent"). Splitting the
 * ladder is a restructure of an estate-wide probe, not a lane conversion, and it belongs with
 * the six worker-invoking admin handlers §2 already lists.
 *
 * THE SHAPE IT SHOULD TAKE ALREADY EXISTS in this codebase: admin/diagnostics/
 * provider-wire-shape.post.ts hands its probe a `DbRunner` (server/diagnostics/
 * provider-wire-probe.ts:122) — `(fn) => withRequestRls(event, fn)` — so each DB read runs in
 * its OWN short RLS-bearing transaction that closes before the fetch after it. Converting this
 * ladder means threading that runner through computeGithubEnterpriseHealth's stages, which is
 * its own change (a scope-widening refactor of an 800-line module), not part of A2.
 *
 * Phase-1 safe, phase-2 NOT: the config tables it reads (`provider_enterprise`, `provider_org`,
 * `github_coverage_observation`) carry no RLS policy, but the roster stage reaches `teammate`
 * via `resolveGithubRoster` (server/reconciliation/adapters/github-identity.ts). Once `teammate`
 * is FORCEd (design §Rollout, phase 2) the roster comes back EMPTY on a context-less connection, and
 * the ladder would report "no teammate matched" — a plausible-looking verdict that is purely an
 * artefact of the missing context. Phase 2 has to restructure this route, not just enable a table.
