/*
 * POST /api/v1/admin/reconciliation/github/map — map an UNRESOLVED github Copilot login to an
 * existing teammate (identity-tail layer 3). Writes the ENTERPRISE lane of teammate_identity_map
 * (source='admin-manual', verified), so the reconciler's roster reader (resolveGithubRoster)
 * picks it up and the login's Copilot spend attributes to the chosen teammate on the next run.
 *
 * Body (zod): { enterpriseId (uuid), login, licenseOrg?, and EXACTLY ONE of teammateId (uuid)
 * | directoryOid (the Entra object id of a picked directory user) }.
 *
 * PROVISION-THEN-MAP (`directoryOid`) — why this route may create a teammate.
 * Binding to an EXISTING teammate was the only mode, which made the flow unusable for the
 * population it serves: an unresolved login is by construction one that bill-driven
 * provisioning never ran for (it is gated behind the same SAML email whose absence puts the
 * login on the list), so the person is typically absent from `teammate` entirely. See the
 * DIRECTORY FALL-THROUGH note in teammate-search.get.ts.
 *
 * It provisions through `provisionDirectoryTeammate`, the SAME service every other admin
 * directory-pick surface uses (admin/teammates.post.ts, org-units/[id]/owners.post.ts,
 * projects/[id]/assignments.post.ts), and follows their ordering exactly: re-resolve the oid
 * server-side, refuse excluded identities, clamp the region, then do ALL writes inside the one
 * request transaction.
 *
 * An earlier revision called the RESOLVER's `provisionAndPlace` instead, reasoning that a
 * hand-mapped seat should land exactly where the automatic path would have put it. That
 * reasoning was wrong in a way worth recording, because it looks right: `provisionAndPlace` is
 * a WORKER function. It owns its own writes, re-homes existing teammates, and replays owed
 * bills, so it cannot be composed into a request transaction — which forced provisioning to
 * run BEFORE the enterprise check and BEFORE both region clamps. A region-scoped admin could
 * therefore re-home a teammate and replay their bills against an enterprise that does not
 * exist, and still be refused the bind afterwards, with the mutation already committed and
 * unaudited. Matching the worker's PLACEMENT is worth less than matching the admin surface's
 * SAFETY.
 *
 * The cost of that trade, stated plainly rather than waved away: a teammate provisioned here
 * lands on the region's `__UNPLACED__` holding node and STAYS there until an admin places them.
 * The region-reenrichment worker does not pick them up — it selects `entra_oid LIKE 'bill:%'`
 * (workers/region-reenrichment.ts), and a directory pick writes a real Entra oid. So this route
 * fixes ATTRIBUTION (the seat's spend now reaches the right person, which is the goal) and
 * leaves PLACEMENT (which practice they roll up to) for the admin. That is exactly the
 * behaviour of the three sibling directory-pick surfaces, so it is a property of the shared
 * service and not a quirk of this route, but it is a real limitation and belongs in the
 * unresolved-users runbook rather than in a comment claiming a worker cleans up after us.
 *
 * IDENTITY KEY: the client sends an `oid`, never an email. `getDirectoryUserByOid` re-resolves
 * it against Entra, so the email and display name written here are directory-attested rather
 * than caller-supplied. The oid ladder inside `provisionDirectoryTeammate` also ADOPTS an
 * existing `bill:` placeholder holding that email, so mapping a seat whose cost had already
 * been provisioned upgrades that row in place rather than minting a duplicate.
 *
 * REGION: the seat's license org gives the natural home (ADR-0010 D4, GitHub org → region)
 * in SEAT mode. In APP mode there is no license org at all (the daily-credits probe has no org
 * dimension, github-unresolved.ts:184 sets it null), so the caller's own region is not an edge
 * case there but the ONLY outcome — an unbounded caller (platform-admin / global-finops) homes
 * every pick into whatever region their session carries. That is survivable because the row
 * lands on `__UNPLACED__` and an admin places it, and because attribution (this route's goal)
 * does not depend on the region; it is NOT a claim that the region is correct.
 *
 * but `licenseOrg` arrives from the client, so it may not be taken on trust. It is used only
 * to CHOOSE a candidate region, which then passes `requireRegionScope` like any other region a
 * caller names. A region admin naming another region's org is refused; global-finops and
 * platform-admin pass through, as everywhere else. An unmapped or absent org falls back to the
 * caller's own region rather than a global bucket.
 *
 * MONEY PATH — invariants (surfaced as clean statuses, never raw 500s):
 *   - enterprise must exist AND be provider='github' (else 404 / 400).
 *   - teammate must exist AND be non-provisional (a provisional shadow is not a real attribution
 *     target — mirrors the money-path guard in github-identity.ts resolveTeammateId).
 *   - login charset is constrained (same floor as me/identities.post).
 *   - the write is the ENTERPRISE lane (enterprise_slug = the slug, lowercased — canonical
 *     casing, mig 0062), on the widened unique key (system, COALESCE(enterprise_slug,''),
 *     lower(identifier)). It is IDEMPOTENT (ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE): an admin re-map cleanly
 *     re-binds (authoritative, like directory-sync). It CANNOT clobber a self-service link —
 *     that row is the NULL lane (a different COALESCE('') key). A genuine constraint race
 *     (e.g. the teammate deleted mid-write) is translated to a clean 409/404, never a 500.
 *
 * RBAC: requireRole(admin, global-finops) + assertSameOrigin. INSERT + audit in ONE tx (SYS-3),
 * so a map never lands unaudited. Mirrors orgs.post.ts / me/identities.post.ts idioms.
 *
 * Region-scope: RLS is inert at runtime (owner connection, no FORCE), so requireRole alone is
 * not a region gate. This is a MONEY-PATH rebind, so BOTH ends are clamped to the caller's
 * region (platform-admin / global-finops pass through, rbac.ts:55):
 *   - the TARGET teammate being mapped TO (tm.region_id) — stops routing a login's spend INTO
 *     another region.
 *   - the teammate CURRENTLY bound to this login (if any), resolved on the same widened key the
 *     upsert's ON CONFLICT targets — stops a region-A admin pulling a login AWAY FROM a
 *     region-B teammate (the one-ended clamp's leak in mirror image).
 * Both checks run after their row is resolved (404-before-403), so an unknown teammateId still
 * 404s and this endpoint never becomes an existence oracle for other regions' teammate ids.
