/*
 * POST /api/v1/admin/reconciliation/github/discover-orgs — onboarding helper that,
 * given a GitHub enterprise, uses its credential to enumerate that enterprise's orgs and
 * AUTO-CREATES the provider_org rows for them. The admin should NOT hand-type (and guess)
 * org slugs when the credential already lists them — this is the GitHub counterpart of
 * the Anthropic `discover` probe.
 *
 * Body (zod): { enterpriseId }.
 *
 * DISCOVERY SOURCE IS PER CREDENTIAL KIND (UF-19), because the two credentials can read
 * different surfaces — and they answer subtly different questions, which the response
 * states rather than hides:
 *   - PAT mode: the ENTERPRISE seat roster's license-orgs (the orgs that actually hold
 *     Copilot seats = the orgs with cost). Unchanged.
 *   - App mode: `installable_organizations` — the orgs the enterprise OWNS. The
 *     enterprise seats endpoint presents a Bearer PAT header, which a withApp() client
 *     does not have (it 401'd), and the per-org seats endpoint cannot be the discovery
 *     source because it needs the org list this route exists to produce. The census is
 *     also the more useful answer at cutover: it names orgs the App is not yet installed
 *     on, which are precisely the ones an admin has to act on. It is NOT filtered to
 *     seat-bearing orgs — `listOrgCopilotSeats` returns [] for an org the App is not
 *     installed on, so filtering would discover nothing on a freshly-App'd enterprise.
 *
 * Each distinct org is UPSERTED as a github provider_org linked to this enterprise
 * (reconciliation_mode='reconciled', billing='tracked'), idempotently — an existing org
 * is left as-is (its region/notes are preserved) but linked to the enterprise if it
 * wasn't. The admin then just sets each org's region.
 *
 * Response 200: { discovered, created, linked, alreadyLinked, credentialKind, capped,
 * orgs: [{login, status}] }. `capped` means the source list was a PREFIX (the provider
 * pagination cap, or this route's own per-call org bound) — discovery is additive, so a
 * prefix is safe, but "discovered N" must not read as "the enterprise has N orgs".
 * A credential failure returns 422 with a SAFE { reason, credentialKind } (no key, no raw
 * provider text — the credential is never echoed or logged). `credentialKind` rides on the
 * failure body too, because the SAME status means different remediations per mode (a 403
 * is "the PAT needs manage_billing" or "the App needs Enterprise organization
 * installations: read") and the caller must not have to assume one.
 *
 * RBAC: requireRole(admin, global-finops) + assertSameOrigin. Audited (per created/linked org).
