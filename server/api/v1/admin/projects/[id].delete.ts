/*
 * DELETE /api/v1/admin/projects/:id — HARD delete a $0-SPEND project (D4 of
 * docs/design/project-lifecycle.md, revised for the lingering-test-project case).
 *
 * Allowed when the project has NO real usage — the two HARD blockers:
 *   - attribution_record  (no spend ever attributed → no money history to lose)
 *   - repo_project_map    (no repo tagged to it → nothing to un-route)
 * The budget allocation, member assignments, any setup tokens and per-conversation
 * session tags are CASCADE-removed (safe when zero spend; and there is no UI to
 * drop a budget, so requiring manual teardown made deletion impractical — the
 * exact friction the reported empty-$0 project hit). Otherwise → 409 (End it
 * instead). Authorization is the same class as create/edit/end (D8):
 * requireRole('admin','global-finops') + requireRegionScope — a region admin
 * still can't delete outside their region even when deletable.
