 * GET /api/v1/admin/diagnostics/instance-telemetry?instanceId=…&hours=…
 *
 * THE NEXT STEP after an attribution gap. The attribution-gap card tells an
 * operator "this device is N days behind". Until now their next move was a KQL
 * query against a workspace that is NSP-locked to the app's managed identity —
 * i.e. a shell they do not have and cannot be given. So the single question that
 * splits the outage in half went unanswered during exactly the incidents it
 * exists for.
 *
 * That question: is this instance's telemetry in ingest AT ALL for the window?
 *   - IN, and unattributed          → the loss is OURS (the joiner). Recover it.
 *   - ABSENT                        → the loss is the CLIENT's. Look at the
 *                                     device, starting with the plugin/CLI
 *                                     versions this same instance now reports.
 * The two facts come from two independent sources on purpose — the ingest store
 * and our own ledger. Reasoning from the ledger alone cannot distinguish them,
 * because "no rows" is equally consistent with both.
 *
 * RBAC: admin / global-finops — the same tier as the attribution-gaps card this
 * hangs off, and the same class of data (one instance id, its counts, its
 * self-reported versions). Deliberately NOT the platform-admin tier that
 * otel-logs.get.ts uses: that endpoint returns RAW Azure result and error packets
 * (status codes, the inner NspValidationFailedError, the exact KQL); this one
 * returns counts, timestamps and a verdict, and its error path is a redacted
 * reason code (server/utils/redact-probe-error.ts), never a raw message. If
 * that ever changes — if raw packets start flowing through here — this gate
 * must move up with it.
 *
 * REGION CLAMP: the instance lookup is hoisted to the top of the handler and
 * gated with an EXPLICIT `requireRegionScope(event, inst.region_id)` before
 * either the ledger count or the ingest probe runs. This is NOT backstopped by
 * RLS — the app connects as the table owner, which Postgres never subjects to
 * RLS regardless of policy or GUCs (see instances/[instanceId].delete.ts's
 * identical note) — so the app-level check is the only gate.
 *
 * Read-only. No caller-supplied KQL: the instance id is validated as a UUID and
 * charset-guarded again inside the reader, and the window is a clamped integer.
