/*
 * POST /api/v1/admin/diagnostics/provider-wire-shape — what do the providers
 * actually send?
 *
 * WHY A POST. It issues LIVE provider calls. A GET would fire on page render, so
 * every admin opening Diagnostics would spend provider budget and walk into rate
 * limits. The trigger is an explicit button, and the free stored-scan mode is the
 * default so a mis-click cannot cost anything.
 *
 * RBAC: requireRole('platform-admin'), matching network.get.ts:23 and
 * otel-logs.get.ts:43 rather than the wider admin/global-finops tier the rest of
 * diagnostics uses. Same reason those two are gated there: this returns RAW
 * provider error bodies and infrastructure-level configuration, and it spends
 * real provider budget. assertSameOrigin because it is a POST (the
 * telemetry-recovery.post.ts convention).
 *
 * AUDITED IN TWO PARTS via recordAuditEvent — this is a privileged operator
 * action that reaches a third party, so who ran it, when, against which surfaces
 * and with what outcome is recorded. An ATTEMPT row is written BEFORE any
 * provider call and an OUTCOME row after: auditing only on the way out means a
 * thrown probe, a crash, or a failed audit write leaves real outbound calls with
 * no record that they were ever made. The payloads carry statuses and counts
 * only: no shape values, no error bodies, no credential, nothing identifying.
 *
 * DB ACCESS: the probe is handed a RUNNER, `(fn) => withRequestRls(event, fn)`,
 * not a handle. Every one of its DB reads therefore runs with the RLS session
 * GUCs set, in its own SHORT transaction that closes before the provider fetch
 * that follows it. Nothing here reaches for the raw pooled handle — the UF-1(a)
 * ratchet (scripts/check-handler-rls-context.mjs) is satisfied on its own terms,
 * not by an allowlist entry — and no transaction is ever held open across a
 * provider call. See DbRunner in server/diagnostics/provider-wire-probe.ts.
 *
 * (That checker greps the file's TEXT, comments included, so do not name the
 * raw-handle accessor here even to say we avoid it.)
 *
 * Read-only: nothing in the probe writes, backfills or mutates.
