/*
 * GET /api/v1/admin/diagnostics — read-only operational health snapshot,
 * the DB-only part: Postgres reachability + active migration, last-sync per
 * source, pipeline freshness and worker execution health. Target < 500 ms warm.
 *
 * The network-bound probes (`services`, `telemetryRead`) live at
 * ./probes.get.ts and the 7-day costing aggregates (`costDrift`,
 * `costingRungs`) at ./costing.get.ts — docs/design/admin-nav-responsiveness.md
 * D4 splits the old single endpoint by COST so the page can draw each panel as
 * its read lands instead of holding the whole page on the slowest probe.
 *
 * RBAC: admin / global-finops. Read-only — no mutations.
 *
 * Four transactions, one per read (postgres probe, lastSync, pipeline,
 * workers), each with its own catch. A failing statement aborts the Postgres
 * transaction it runs in, so two reads that must survive each other's failure
 * cannot share one; and a read that shares a transaction with a catch-and-
 * continue probe would see that probe's abort. The three table reads are
 * therefore NOT issued concurrently on one connection (F5) — the concurrency
 * is worth less than a card that stays populated when its neighbour's table is
 * absent. Each block is wrapped so one failure never 500s the endpoint.
 *
 * A caught failure keeps the read's empty/unknown initialiser so existing
 * consumers keep working, and DECLARES itself in `reads` — one
 * `{ available }` entry per independently-fallible read, with a classified
 * reason and a correlation id when false. Without it an aborted query and a
 * genuinely empty table are the same bytes on the wire, and the page renders
 * "no worker runs yet" for "the workers query failed". (`postgres` is not in
 * `reads`: it already declares itself with `reachable: false` + `error`.)
 *
 * BullMQ / Redis are NOT wired in MVP-Final (no `redis` or `bullmq`
 * package in dependencies as of Wave V). The diagnostics endpoint
 * returns `unavailable: true` for those sections so the UI can render
 * a placeholder card without a dependency on a runtime that doesn't
 * exist yet.
