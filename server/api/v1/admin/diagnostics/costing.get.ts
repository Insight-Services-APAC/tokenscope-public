/*
 * GET /api/v1/admin/diagnostics/costing — the 7-day costing aggregates of the
 * diagnostics snapshot: `costDrift` (our rate-card estimate vs the provider's
 * figure, v_cost_drift) and `costingRungs` (which rung of the precedence
 * ladder priced real spend, attribution_record.cost_basis).
 *
 * Split out of GET /diagnostics (docs/design/admin-nav-responsiveness.md D4):
 * both are fact-table scans over a week of partitions, the most expensive
 * reads the old single endpoint carried, and the page draws their panel as a
 * skeleton until they land. The two queries are byte-identical to the blocks
 * they were cut from. Each runs in its OWN transaction with its own catch: a
 * failing statement aborts the transaction it is in, and `costDrift` can fail
 * on its own (v_cost_drift is absent on a pre-0045 database), so sharing one
 * would blank the rungs card whenever the drift card is unavailable. F5
 * concurrent issuance is deliberately not used here for that reason.
 *
 * A caught failure keeps the read's ZERO shape so existing consumers keep
 * working, but never returns it unlabelled: `reads.costDrift` /
 * `reads.costingRungs` carry `available` (plus a classified reason and a
 * correlation id when false). Zero spans and a failed query are otherwise the
 * same bytes, and the card would report "no data" for "we could not find out".
 *
 * RBAC: admin / global-finops (the same gate as the snapshot). Read-only.
