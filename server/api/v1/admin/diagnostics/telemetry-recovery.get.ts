/*
 * GET /api/v1/admin/diagnostics/telemetry-recovery — widened-read queue status.
 *
 * The companion to the POST. A recovery is drained asynchronously in slices, so
 * "is it done, and did it actually recover anything?" has to be answerable
 * afterwards — otherwise the operator is back to inferring success from a 2xx,
 * which is the exact failure this feature exists to remove.
 *
 * Reports PROGRESS (cursor over the scoped instance count) and OUTCOME
 * (rows_written, errors) separately, because they answer different questions: a
 * request can be 100% processed and have written zero rows, which is a real and
 * important result — it means the backlog was not where the operator thought.
 *
 * RBAC: admin / global-finops. Read-only, and the same tier as the attribution-gap
 * list it is used beside; enqueueing (the side that spends query budget) is
 * global-finops-only on the POST.
 *
 * REGION CLAMP: telemetry_recovery_request has no region column of its own — a
 * request's `instance_ids` can span regions (an operator recovering telemetry
 * estate-wide). A region-scoped `admin` sees only requests that touch AT LEAST
 * ONE instance in their own region (an EXISTS membership check against
 * instance_attestation); global-finops / platform-admin keep the estate-wide
 * queue, matching the pattern used by attribution-gaps and instance-telemetry.
