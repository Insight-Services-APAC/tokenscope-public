/*
 * POST /api/v1/admin/users/bulk-place { teammate_ids[], org_unit_id }
 * — place many teammates into one cost centre in a single action.
 *
 * THE GAP THIS CLOSES. A region admin looking at "Unplaced · 290 teammates" had
 * exactly one write available: PATCH /admin/users/:id/org-unit, one person at a
 * time. This is that same write, batched.
 *
 * IT IS THE SAME WRITE, LITERALLY. Every id goes through
 * server/db/place-teammate.ts — the same region-scope check, the same
 * target-unit containment, the same provenance strip, the same audit event
 * type as the single-row move. Nothing about who may move whom is re-decided
 * here. What this handler owns is the batch: the target-unit pre-flight, the
 * per-id failure isolation, and the batch id.
 *
 * ── AUTHORISATION ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Two checks that only mean something together:
 *   - up front, once: `requireRegionScope` against the TARGET UNIT's region, so
 *     a region admin cannot place INTO another region's unit — and finds out
 *     before any row moves rather than N times over;
 *   - per id, inside placeTeammate: `requireRegionScope` against the TEAMMATE's
 *     region, plus "the target unit is in the teammate's own region".
 * The first alone would let a caller move another region's people into their own
 * unit; the second alone would 422 late and per-row. Both are pinned by
 * tests/integration/admin/placement-remediation.test.ts against real cross-region
 * fixtures — an authorisation test whose fixture has no foreign data proves
 * nothing — and by the two interleaving tests there, because a check that another
 * transaction can invalidate before the UPDATE lands is advisory, not enforced.
 *
 * `global-finops` is region-unbounded and passes both scope checks, but is NOT
 * exempt from containment: the target unit must still be in the teammate's own
 * region, so no role can use this endpoint to move a person across regions. That
 * is the region PATCH's job, and it runs a revoke cascade this one must not.
 *
 * ── PARTIAL FAILURE, AND WHAT IS *NOT* ONE ────────────────────────────────
 * One bad id must not discard 39 good placements, so each id runs in its own
 * SAVEPOINT (a nested transaction on the RLS transaction drizzle already opened).
 * A throw rolls back that id ONLY — including its audit row, so the audit never
 * claims a placement that was rolled back — and the loop continues.
 *
 * ONLY A 4xx BECOMES A PER-ID OUTCOME. A deadlock, a lost connection, a
 * constraint violation or a plain programming error is not a refusal of one
 * user's placement: nobody decided anything about that teammate, and the batch's
 * remaining ids ran against a database that had just failed. Catching those
 * turned an infrastructure failure into forty tidy "refused" rows behind a 200,
 * with the driver's own message echoed to the client. They are RETHROWN, the
 * enclosing transaction rolls back, and the request fails as a request.
 *
 * A consequence worth stating: every per-id refusal happens BEFORE that id's
 * audit INSERT, so the SAVEPOINT no longer has an aborted statement to recover
 * from on any reachable path. It is kept as the guarantee that a refusal added
 * LATER — after a write — still cannot leave a half-placement behind; it is no
 * longer load-bearing today. Do not read the savepoint as evidence that DB
 * errors are survivable here. They are not, by design.
 *
 * The batch is capped at BULK_PLACE_MAX ids, which is deliberately the same as
 * the teammates list's maximum page (server/api/v1/admin/teammates.get.ts): the
 * worklist cannot show more than one page, so it cannot select more than one
 * page, and a cap the UI can exceed is a cap that turns into a 400 mid-journey.
