/*
 * PATCH /api/v1/admin/users/:id/org-unit { org_unit_id } — move a
 * teammate to another cost centre WITHIN their existing region.
 *
 * Why this is distinct from the region PATCH: this is an intra-region
 * move. It changes which cost centre the teammate's spend rolls up to,
 * but NOT what they can see — their region scope and org_path-derived
 * visibility are unchanged. So, unlike PATCH .../region (which re-scopes
 * a teammate and therefore bumps revoked_at to force a re-login), this
 * endpoint must NOT bump revoked_at: the teammate's live sessions stay
 * valid.
 *
 * Admin / global-finops only. Everything below the request parsing —
 * the region-scope check, the target-unit containment, the provenance
 * strip and the audit row — is server/db/place-teammate.ts, SHARED with
 * POST /admin/users/bulk-place so the two surfaces cannot drift on who
 * may move whom. This one keeps the 'any-active-unit' target policy: it
 * is a general per-row move, not the "get spend to a cost centre" bulk
 * action, and moving someone onto a plain team node is legitimate here.
