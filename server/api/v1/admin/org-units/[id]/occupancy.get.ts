/*
 * GET /api/v1/admin/org-units/{id}/occupancy — who is in this unit that does not
 * belong to it, and whose team they are (spec C9).
 *
 * The org-unit tree already renders the COUNTS inline; this is the list behind
 * them. It exists as its own request because the clusters are unbounded — a
 * region president owning `(default)` can catch hundreds of people across dozens
 * of managers — and putting that in the tree payload would make every render of
 * every region pay for a panel most admins have not opened.
 *
 * Both build their SQL from server/db/default-unit-occupancy.ts, so "12 of 340
 * are not direct reports" on the row and the clusters inside it are the same
 * question asked once.
 *
 * ── DEFAULT UNITS ONLY, AND IT ENFORCES IT ────────────────────────────────────
 * Every number below is catch-all arithmetic: "occupants who are not the owner's
 * direct reports" only means "landed here because no nearer owner exists" on the
 * unit the walk falls back TO, and `placement.default_unit_warn_threshold` is a
 * span-of-control dial for that unit. On an ordinary cost centre the same counts
 * are a different question with a different answer, and the threshold is nobody's
 * dial. Returning `is_default` while happily computing all of it for any unit made
 * the flag decoration; a non-default unit is refused instead. (The spec's
 * "generalises beyond default" stays a later change, with semantics of its own —
 * not an accident of an unenforced flag.)
 *
 * ── WHY THE THRESHOLD IS READ HERE AND NOT WRITTEN DOWN ───────────────────────
 * `placement.default_unit_warn_threshold` is a governance dial (mig 0049
 * precedence: a region override beats the platform baseline). Span of control
 * differs by organisation, so a constant would be one tenant's shape shipped as a
 * product rule. It is returned alongside the counts so the client renders the
 * verdict the server reached rather than re-deciding it with a number of its own.
 *
 * RBAC: admin / global-finops, then requireRegionScope against the UNIT's region —
 * the occupants are that region's teammates.
