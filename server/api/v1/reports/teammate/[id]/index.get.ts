/*
 * GET /api/v1/reports/teammate/{id}?src&month|from&to — the E3 CONTRIBUTION
 * view of one named individual (developer pages build D31-D36).
 *
 * ONE round trip: identity, TokenSheet by project (two operands per row),
 * surface + provenance mix, worklist pressure, and the chip-row meta operands.
 * Model donut, cache economics, insights, quota and peer stats are ABSENT — not
 * `.gap`-ed (prototype `:848`): they are structurally unpopulatable for arms-2/3
 * subjects and behavioural rather than contributional. Their absence is pinned
 * by test, not merely unrendered.
 *
 * ── THE ORDER OF OPERATIONS IS THE SECURITY CONTRACT ────────────────────────
 *   1. authenticate + resolve grants LIVE (never cached — plan D5)
 *   2. resolve the `?src=` FRAME against the caller's own grants (D33) — a
 *      frame they do not hold is a 403 here, before any subject read
 *   3. the D34 gate: emit-time homing EXISTS ∧ `is_active`, through the ONE
 *      exported rule `teammateDrillAdmission` (D38)
 *   4. AUDIT — in the handler, BEFORE the response cache, so a cache HIT still
 *      writes a row (an audit inside `compute` fires only for the leader)
 *   5. FRESHNESS — evaluated on EVERY request, BEFORE the cache lookup (r1-H7),
 *      so a warm body becomes unreachable the moment the threshold passes
 *   6. only then the cached compute
 *
 * ── `Cache-Control: no-store`, ALWAYS (r1-H6/r2-M1) ─────────────────────────
 * The inherited report-cache contract sets `private, max-age=60`. A browser
 * cache hit never reaches this handler — so no audit row would be written and no
 * refusal could intervene. Both are unacceptable on a named-person surface, so
 * the browser layer is disabled outright here. The internal identity-keyed
 * SERVER cache stays: it is behind the audit and the freshness check.
 *
 * No `attribution_record` / raw `actual_spend` / `attribution_aggregate` — the
 * lane firewall scans this directory.
