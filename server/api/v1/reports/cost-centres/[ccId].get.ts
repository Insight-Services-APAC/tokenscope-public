/*
 * GET /api/v1/reports/cost-centres/[ccId]?month&axis — the Cost-Centre BURN drill
 * (docs/design/reporting-consolidation/00-build-design.md §2/§3/§4, Wave 3).
 *
 * READS (§A completeness lane, the SAME axis as the tracker card burn):
 *   - burn total + vendor split → `v_complete_usage WHERE cost_owning_unit_id`
 *     (Copilot pooled NULL-CoU rows excluded by construction — the labelled §A gap).
 *   - axis drivers (project|teammate|model|surface): what/who is burning the budget.
 *     The three BURN axes sum back to `burnUsd` — including a spender whose CURRENT
 *     placement has moved (§A homes by emit-time cost_owning_unit_id, so they never
 *     vanish from the burn). The PROJECT axis is clamped on the project's own
 *     cost-owning unit and so carries its own `headlineUsd`/`denominatorLabel`
 *     (arm 2 has a real project and a NULL cost-owning unit — clamping it like the
 *     burn axes would delete every reconciled dollar). Render `headlineUsd`, never
 *     `burnUsd`, as the drivers' denominator.
 *   - the two HEROES the screen renders side by side (04-prototype-delta.md §5b):
 *     `budgets` (the project axis, UNCAPPED — at one cost centre the list IS the
 *     population) and `people` (the teammate axis). Each carries its own
 *     headline/denominator for the reason above; they are not two views of one
 *     total. `?axis=` still answers a SINGLE axis for a script, a saved link or
 *     the CSV export, and is the same computation aliased, never a second query.
 *   - the CC's current-effective allocation (burn-vs-budget context) — DERIVED,
 *     the roll-up of its projects' budgets, and labelled so on the face.
 * The §B chargeback/billing for this CC lives in the Finance scope's CoU drill —
 * NOT duplicated here (a budget-BURN tracker's drill shows consumption, not invoices).
 *
 * RBAC (build-design §2 — resource-anchored, anti-IDOR): grant iff the caller's
 * TWO GATES since 2026-08-10. `requireReportScope(event, tx, 'cost-centre')`
 * first — may this caller see the SCOPE at all — which the sibling list route
 * has always asked and this one did not, so a denied scope was reachable by
 * anyone the subtree predicate admits. Then the resource gate below.
 * region/subtree scope covers the CC (orgSubtreeScopePredicate) OR they OWN it
 * (an active cou_owner row) — folded INTO the resolving query
 * (resolveCostCentreDrill, S3 part e). A non-existent CC, a retired/non-cost-
 * owning unit, and a foreign/unowned CC all collapse to the SAME 403 — the old
 * two-step (existence 404, then ownership/region 403) was an existence oracle
 * over which cost centres exist in a region the caller can't see.
 *
 * No `attribution_record` / raw `actual_spend` / `v_finance_*` (the lane firewall, §7(7)).
