/*
 * GET /api/v1/reports/cost-centres/[ccId]/trend — BAND 2, the rolling band.
 *
 * The approved prototype draws four surfaces on the cost-centre page below the
 * month band — Active developers over time, Spend trend, Spend per active
 * developer, and Where the AI spend goes. None were built, because they live in
 * the unconditional tail of the prototype's `across()` rather than inside an
 * `if(SK==='cc')` block, so nobody looking for cost-centre code found them.
 * `docs/design/reporting-consolidation/inventory.json` records them;
 * `tests/unit/reporting/prototype-parity.test.ts` asserts them.
 *
 * ── ONE ROUTE, NOT THREE ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Region splits this across `/trend`, `/active-trend` and `/behaviour` because
 * its cards load independently at whole-company width, where each scan is
 * expensive. A cost centre is one drill on one clamp, and the four cards share a
 * single band and a single window: three round-trips would buy nothing and would
 * let the band's own cards disagree about the window they cover. So they are
 * fetched together and the band is drawn from one answer.
 *
 * ── THE WINDOW IS THE CALLER'S, AND IT IS NOT THE MONTH ──────────────────────
 * The band is a ROLLING window (~60 days ending at the settled edge), computed
 * client-side by `rollingTrendWindow(clock)` and passed as `from`/`to` — the same
 * mechanism `ScopeAcrossRegions` uses, so both scopes' bands mean the same thing.
 * It deliberately does not sum into the month band above it, and the card copy
 * says so.
 *
 * AUTHZ IS TWO GATES, and the first one was missing until 2026-08-10.
 * `requireReportScope(event, tx, 'cost-centre')` asks whether the caller may see
 * this SCOPE at all — the sibling list route has always asked it, these did not.
 * Then `resolveCostCentreDrill`, the anti-IDOR gate: absent, retired, non-cost-owning, foreign-region and unowned all collapse
 * to one 403 rather than leaking which cost-centre ids exist.
