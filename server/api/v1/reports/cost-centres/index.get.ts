/*
 * GET /api/v1/reports/cost-centres?month — the Cost-Centre reporting scope card
 * grid (docs/design/reporting-consolidation/00-build-design.md §2/§3, Wave 3).
 *
 * READS (build-design §4 lane matrix): burn = `v_complete_usage WHERE
 * cost_owning_unit_id` (the PROJECT-CoU USAGE axis — Copilot NULL-CoU pooled rows
 * are excluded by construction and labelled). Allocation joins the CC's lead
 * projects. The card carries BOTH on-track mechanics, kept DISTINCT:
 *   - exhaustionDate — the BUDGET-exhaustion DATE (projections.ts), a date.
 *   - forecast       — the RUN-RATE dollar projection (forecast.ts), a $.
 * Both are computed only on the in-progress month (closed months → null/null).
 *
 * RBAC (build-design §2): `requireAuth` + in-query scope = `getOwnedCostCentreIds`
 * ∪ the caller's cost-owning subtree (fetchVisibleCostCentres). NO region
 * denominators for pure owners — the scope is the set of visible CCs, nothing
 * wider. Every figure re-enforces its own gate.
 *
 * No `attribution_record` / raw provider-bill table (the lane firewall, §7(7)).
