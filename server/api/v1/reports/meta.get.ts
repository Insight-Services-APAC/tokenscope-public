 * GET /api/v1/reports/meta — the ONE bootstrap fetch for the reporting shell
 * (docs/design/reporting-consolidation/00-build-design.md §2).
 *
 * Returns:
 *   - scopes            → the GRANTED scopes only (role + CC-ownership derived).
 *   - defaultScope      → best-granted (region → cost-centre → finance).
 *   - monthFloors       → MIN over the lanes (usage / bill / reconciliation),
 *                         daily-cacheable; `overall` = the picker floor.
 *   - providerStates    → settling states for the current month (settling.ts).
 *   - copilotMode       → 'pool-utilisation' | 'chargeback' (copilot-mode.ts).
 *
 * `requireAuth` — every scope re-enforces its own gate; this is the UX bootstrap.
 * Reads views/aggregate tables only — no `attribution_record` / raw `actual_spend`

     *     on where their own record happens to sit: an ORG-WIDE role
     *     (`ORG_WIDE_ROLES` — global-finops AND platform-admin) answers for no
     *     single region, so it opens on the FIRST region by (display_name, code);
     *     only a REGION-BOUND role opens on its own home region. That rule lives in

     *     Regional response. A second, differently-computed answer to the same
     *     question — cached here for an hour — is exactly the "wrong region under a
     *     wrong name" hazard that rule exists to remove.
     *
     * Any consumer that needs the effective region reads it from
     * `/reports/region` (`region` + `regionOptions` + `allRegionsAvailable`), which
     * is the region the figures beside it were actually computed for — and, since
     * the Across merge, the WIDTH they were computed at.
