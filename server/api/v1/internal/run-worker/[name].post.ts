/*
 * POST /api/v1/internal/run-worker/{name} — machine-to-machine
 * entrypoint for the worker scheduler.
 *
 * Authentication: HMAC-SHA-256 signed request via
 * server/auth/internal-request.ts. The external scheduler (Azure
 * Function timer, k8s CronJob, or equivalent) signs each request with
 * NUXT_INTERNAL_WORKER_HMAC_KEY and the (timestamp, method, path,
 * body-sha256) tuple. Replay window: +/- 300 seconds.
 *
 * Worker selection: by URL parameter {name}, looked up in the
 * static registry (server/workers/registry.ts). Unknown names are
 * rejected with 404 BEFORE any worker code is loaded — auditable
 * surface, no dynamic discovery.
 *
 * Execution health: each dispatch is wrapped in worker_run bookkeeping
 * (insert a 'running' row before, transition to 'success'/'failure'
 * after) so admin diagnostics can surface a FAILING worker. The
 * freshness panel measures data recency and stayed green while the
 * joiner cron failed every run — this is the missing per-worker signal.
 * Bookkeeping is best-effort: it MUST NOT break the worker (own
 * try/catch) and MUST NOT swallow the worker's own error (re-thrown).
 *
 * Why machine-to-machine endpoint instead of in-process cron:
 *   - Multi-instance safe (no boot-time singleton race)
 *   - Observable (HTTP logs, status code, duration metrics)
 *   - Same control plane for dev (curl + signed body) and prod (Azure
 *     Function timer)
 *
 * Why a static registry instead of dynamic file load:
 *   - The set of runnable worker names is auditable in one place
 *   - Unknown names short-circuit at the registry without touching
 *     worker code (defense in depth if HMAC ever leaks)
