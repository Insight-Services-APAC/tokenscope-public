/*
 * POST /api/v1/me/sessions/{sid}/assign  { project_id?, activity? } — tag OR
 * RE-TAG a Claude conversation. The universal correction primitive:
 *   - project_id: uuid  → assign / re-point to a project budget (membership-gated)
 *   - project_id: null  → move OFF budget (unallocated)
 *   - activity:   string→ tag an activity (orthogonal axis)
 *   - activity:   null  → clear the activity
 *   - field omitted     → preserve that axis
 * At least one field must be present.
 *
 * Since the joiner itemises ALL spend into attribution_record (mig 0021), every
 * conversation already has ledger rows. This UPDATEs them directly (the change is
 * immediate) and records the decision in session_assignment (durable for future
 * joiner runs — the joiner dedups with ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING, so it never reverts
 * these rows for already-recorded events). Known limit: on a STILL-EMITTING
 * conversation whose repo emits a project.code_hash (B′), brand-new events keep
 * following that hash until tracked separately — correcting a past/closed
 * conversation is fully durable.
 *
 * Ownership is AR-based: the conversation must have attribution_record rows for
 * THIS teammate (the joiner writes them from the unspoofable attestation), which
 * also covers itemised unallocated rows. Membership gate (tag proposes, membership
 * disposes) applies only when SETTING a non-null project.
