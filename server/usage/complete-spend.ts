/*
 * complete-spend — THE §A spend seam. One lane, one window, one definition of
 * "what a project has spent", at every grain any surface needs.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS IS THE ONLY PLACE ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 * "Project spend this month" used to be computed in five places from three
 * sources: `attribution_aggregate` (the project header + the /projects cards),
 * `attribution_record` (the team-contribution table, the activity donut, the
 * budget editor, the manager rollup) and `v_complete_usage` (the budget alert).
 * The consequences were all real: a page rendered a stale cron-refreshed
 * headline above a live table with nothing disclosing it; "Manage budget →"
 * walked the PM to a DIFFERENT number at the moment they decided whether to
 * extend; and the alert that paged them was computed on a third lane again.
 *
 * The worst of it was structural, not cosmetic. `attribution_aggregate` and
 * `attribution_record` carry OTel-EMITTED spend only. `v_complete_usage`
 * additionally carries arm 2 (the API−OTel reconciliation gap) and arm 3 (the
 * ingest-only lane). At today's adoption most consumption arrives via
 * reconciliation, so the project manager's headline was structurally the
 * SMALLEST number in the product, and a PM reporting cost-versus-profit from it
 * under-reported cost. The gap widens as adoption grows.
 *
 * So: every project figure on every surface comes from this module, reading
 * `v_complete_usage` filtered on `project_id`. A second query that "agrees
 * today" is the defect, not the fix.
 *
 * ── THE LANE, AND WHAT IT CANNOT CARRY (mig 0101) ────────────────────────────
 * `v_complete_usage` is three UNION ALL arms and their coverage is NOT uniform:
 *
 *   arm 1 `otel-emitted`   attribution_record. Carries project_id, activity,
 *                          model, token_type, identity_state.
 *   arm 2 `api-reconciled` unaccounted_usage (the API−OTel gap). Carries
 *                          project_id and activity — it is taggable in the same
 *                          needs-tagging flow. Since migs 0123/0124 the view
 *                          fans each fill row into its write-time MEASURED
 *                          per-model children plus at most ONE reason-typed
 *                          NULL-model remainder (07-model-axis D3/D4);
 *                          `token_type` stays 'unknown' on every arm-2 row.
 *   arm 3 `provider-usage` the ingest-only surfaces (non-Code Claude, the
 *                          coding-agent lane). `project_id` is NULL BY
 *                          CONSTRUCTION: this money is untaggable, so it can
 *                          never be an operand of a project budget. `activity`
 *                          and `model` are NULL for the same structural reason.
 *
 * Two rules follow, and both are enforced by the functions below rather than
 * left to each caller:
 *   1. A project total on this lane CANNOT include arm-3 spend. That money must
 *      never be silently dropped and must never render as a zero — it gets an
 *      EXPLICIT, separately labelled bucket
 *      ({@link completeProjectMemberLaneExclusions}).
 *   2. The per-MODEL split of a project total covers arms 1+2: the reconciled
 *      arm's measured children fan out of the view (migs 0123/0124) and
 *      {@link completeProjectModelMix} keeps its reason-typed remainders as
 *      remainder ROWS (one per reason, `__`-sentinel keys) that the Top-models
 *      coverage footer prices — never category rows. Every project total still
 *      reports `reconciledUsd` — a PROVENANCE disclosure (how much of the
 *      headline was reconciled rather than emitted), no longer a claim that
 *      the reconciled share has no model axis.
 *
 * ── TOOL COMPLETENESS ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Copilot per-user usage does NOT reach `attribution_record` (native OTLP is
 * default-off), so any figure reading the ledger alone is silently blind to
 * Copilot: a Copilot-heavy project never trips its budget. Per-tool cost math
 * runs ONCE at ingest (azure-monitor-reader's computeCopilotCost vs token rate
 * cards), so `cost_usd` is uniform and readers must never re-implement per-tool
 * cost. There is no `tool` branching here or in any caller.
 *
 * ── THE PROVISIONAL OPTION ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `identity_state = 'provisional'` means the teammate/device binding is not yet
 * confirmed. Manager-facing figures drop it (an unconfirmed binding must never
 * page a PM or move a budget decision), and the five project sites all set
 * {@link ProjectSpendOptions.excludeProvisional} so the page, the budget editor
 * and the alert cannot disagree. It is a NAMED option on this function rather
 * than a second query, and every total reports `provisionalUsd` alongside so a
 * surface can say WHY its number differs from the raw lane instead of quietly
 * differing. This is deliberately NOT what `getMyUsage` does: a dev's own
 * homepage correctly shows their pre-confirmation spend. Different audience,
 * different rule — do not "fix" one to match the other.

 * ── THE BURN AXIS, AND WHY ONE TERM SITS OUTSIDE THE IDENTITY ────────────────

 * `tag-session.ts` (`cou = p.cost_owning_unit_id`) and the ingest path in
 * `azure-monitor-reader.ts` (`cou = proj.cost_owning_unit_id`) — and both leave
 * it NULL when there is no project. So UNTAGGED money has no burn home on

 * reconciliation arm.
 *
 * Which leaves a real hole: taggable spend that nobody has claimed for a
 * project is in the §A estate, in nobody's burn, and in none of the four terms
 * above. {@link CostCentreLaneResidual.memberUntaggedUsd} closes it on the only

 * choice — it decides which arms of the lane survive (mig 0101):
 *
 *   over `u`  (region / org-unit / whole-company): every arm in scope. NULL
 *             `project_id` rows fall into the untagged bucket, so the rows sum
 *             back to the scope's own usage total.
 *   over `p`  (a cost centre's projects): the PROJECT's stable home, which is
 *             also the basis of the allocation denominator. Arm 2 rows carry a
 *             NULL `cost_owning_unit_id` BY CONSTRUCTION while carrying a real

 * {@link completeProjectAxisSpend} is a RANKED seam: its answer is "the projects
 * that are burning this scope, and one named row for everything else". That is
 * the right answer for a whole-company or regional driver table, where the axis
 * groups every project in the estate and the reader is exploring. Raising its
 * cap to serve one scope would change what the seam MEANS for every other
 * surface reading it — the largest scope would quietly become the unbounded one
 * again, which is the exact regression {@link PROJECT_AXIS_ROW_CAP} exists to
 * prevent.
 *
 * This variant answers a different question, and only where that question is
 * asked: at a single cost centre, the list **is** the population. A top-N there
 * hides the row the owner opened the page to find, and the folded "(all other —
 * N projects)" row is not a thing they can act on — they own each of those
 * projects individually. So: no cap, and the caller states on its face that the
 * list is complete.
 *
 * Bound in practice by the SCOPE, not by a limit: pass a predicate that clamps
 * to one cost centre (or an equally narrow set). Handing this a whole-company
 * clamp would ship the estate to render one table — use the ranked seam there.
 *
 * The untagged bucket (a NULL `projectId` row) still appears when the caller's
 * clamp admits NULL-project rows, exactly as in the ranked seam, so the rows
 * still sum back to the caller's own headline. `remainderProjects` is 0 on every

/**
 * Per-model mix for ONE project over a RESOLVED window — the project page's

 * OTel-only `attribution_aggregate` (07-model-axis D7): a tagged fill day's
 * measured models (mig 0123 children, fanned out by mig 0124) appear beside
 * the emitted ones, so the mix stops contradicting the headline it sits under.
 *
 * Two generalisations from the donut era (developer-pages W3 D27.4):
 *
 *  1. WINDOW (r1-H9): takes the page's resolved `[startIso, endIso)` bounds —
 *     month or custom, the same window as the hero — instead of a trailing
 *     30/90-day parameter, so the breakdown can never sit beside a
 *     differently-windowed headline.
 *  2. SHAPE: rows are REASON-TYPED, keyed/labelled through the ONE classifier
 *     (`modelDriverKey`/`modelDriverLabel`, shared/reports/model-attribution.ts)
 *     and folded by that key exactly like the reporting model axis — a named
 *     model merges across provenances; remainders stay one row PER REASON so
 *     the Top-models coverage footer can price each reason separately. The
 *     ONE-shared-bucket fold this replaces was the composition DONUT's
 *     contract ("this is a composition donut, not the Top-models card"); the
 *     donut dies under fix 3 and the Top-models treatment takes over.
 *     `ModelSplitPanel`'s classifier sends every `__`-sentinel key to the
 *     footer, so a remainder can never become a category row.
 *
 * The provisional option is OPT-IN and defaults OFF, preserving every existing
 * caller: the aggregate read this replaced had no identity_state axis, so
 * omitting it was a data-source switch rather than a semantics change. A
 * MANAGER-FACING caller whose headline drops provisional spend must pass the
 * SAME option here (r3-H2) — the panel divides by the mix's own Σ, and a Σ that
 * counts money the headline above it does not is two totals on one card.
