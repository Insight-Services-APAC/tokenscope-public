 * NAMING. This module is the read-model behind the page now called MY USAGE
 * (`/usage`, served by `server/api/v1/me/usage.get.ts`). The module keeps the
 * name `consumption` deliberately: it is internal, no user reads it, and

 * is not a word the product says out loud any more — one word, one meaning.
 *
 * Perf contract (brief §6.5): list/series/mix queries read the AGGREGATE
 * only. The single sanctioned raw-ledger exception is the per-project
 * DETAIL page (member contribution, activity mix, untagged pressure):
 * one-project-at-a-time, month-bounded, served by the (project_id,
 * ts_event) / (teammate_id, ts_event) indexes — codified in

/**
 * Σ advisory (tier-2 / telemetry-only) spend for a scope over an EXPLICIT
 * half-open `[startIso, endIso)` window.
 *
 * Restores the project page's advisory disclosure (fix sprint D27). Two things
 * about the signature are deliberate:
 *
 *  - **Explicit bounds, not `windowDays`.** Every other read in this module says
 *    `period_start >= now() - N days`, which is the DATABASE's clock — a second
 *    definition of today (`clock-and-day-boundary.md`, and the static gate).
 *    The caller resolves the window from the request clock and passes it, so the
 *    footer's window is provably the one the chart above it drew.
 *  - **A number, not a formatted string.** Zero advisory must render NOTHING —
 *    never "$0.00", which would assert a measurement we have not made. The
 *    caller decides that, and it needs the number to decide it.
 *  - **The COVERED DAYS ride with the figure** (external review r2). Returning a
 *    bare number said "here is the window's advisory spend" whether the rollup
 *    had materialised thirty days of it or three: total absence answered `null`,
 *    but a window missing SOME days came back as a confident window total, which
 *    is the same unknown one step in. The days the aggregate actually holds a
 *    row for are returned alongside the sum so the caller can test them against
 *    the days it KNOWS carry spend and stop claiming the window when they
 *    disagree. This is a fact, not a completeness estimate: the aggregate cannot
 *    tell "the rollup has not run for this day" from "nothing was spent that
 *    day", and this function does not guess which — it reports what it holds.
 *  - **`null`, not `0`, when the aggregate has nothing to say.** `SUM` over an
 *    empty set is NULL, and the `COALESCE(…, 0)` that used to sit here spent
 *    that distinction: a scope whose rollup has not been materialised for this
 *    window (the aggregate is the ONE cron-fed lane on the project page) came
 *    back indistinguishable from a scope the rollup HAS covered and measured at
 *    zero advisory. NULL IS NOT 0 — this project's recurring defect class. The
 *    caller ships the absence through to the wire so the client can stay silent
 *    for the honest reason rather than for a fabricated one.
 *
 * POPULATION — read this before putting the number beside another figure.
 * `attribution_aggregate` carries NO identity dimension (drizzle/schema/
 * attribution.ts) and `aggregate-rollup.ts` applies no identity filter, so this
 * sum spans PROVISIONAL identities too. It is also the OTel rollup lane alone:
 * no arm-2 reconciliation, no arm-3 ingest-only, and none of `v_complete_usage`
 * arm 1's exclusions (quarantined sessions, the non-Claude-Code tool list). A
 * §A-lane figure drawn with `excludeProvisional` — which is every manager-facing
 * project figure — is therefore a DIFFERENT population, and no filter argument
 * here can close the gap: the dimension is not in the table. Callers must
 * disclose the basis rather than imply the two agree.
