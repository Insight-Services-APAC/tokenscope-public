/*
 * ab-decomposition — the §A/§B delta decomposition module.
 *
 * Decomposes the gap between §A (attributed usage, v_complete_usage) and §B
 * (chargeable, v_finance_chargeback_month) into the named, mutually exclusive
 * terms of AB_DECOMPOSITION_TERMS (the design predicted six; there are more,
 * and the const is the count — see its header for why each was added).
 * The residual MUST be zero if the decomposition is exhaustive.
 *
 * Term counts AND term ordinals are deliberately NOT restated in prose here or
 * anywhere else: three rounds of review added terms and each one left a stale
 * count behind in a different file. The const is the count AND the order.
 *
 * The ordinal half of that rule was learned the hard way, twice. Numbered
 * headers ("Term 3", "Terms 8 + 9") were kept alongside the const; inserting
 * copilotAgentUsage produced a "Term 3a" rather than a renumber, and inserting
 * chargebackExemptUsage then left TWO blocks both labelled "Term 7" and three
 * files disagreeing about which term was which. Renumbering would only have
 * reset the clock until the twelfth term. Blocks and plantings are labelled by
 * NAME, and cross-references name the term they mean. A name cannot go stale
 * when a term is inserted above it.
 *
 * Design: docs/design/usage-completeness-and-provider-governance.md §1.1
 * ("Gate on a full decomposition, not a subtraction").
 *
 * This module is the LOGIC — no HTTP handler, no route. A later task adds the
 * endpoint and admin UI card. Follows the precedent in
 * server/api/v1/admin/diagnostics/attribution-gaps.get.ts: "If a check matters
 * enough to run, it belongs in the product."

   *     reconciliation ever used, double-counting money the quarantine term
   *     already accounts for.
   *  2. Day binning. Reconciliation bins on (ts_event AT TIME ZONE 'UTC')::date.
   *     A bare ts_event::date casts using the session TimeZone, so on any server
   *     not set to UTC the two disagree at every day boundary and the excess is
   *     compared against the wrong day's API truth.
   *
   * Neither drift shows up as a non-zero residual unless a quarantined session
   * happens to land on a day where OTel already exceeds the API, which is why the

   *     reaches NEITHER v_teammate_usage_daily's actual_spend branch nor (by
   *     extension) v_complete_usage. §B comes from `copilot_pool_bill`. An
   *     exempt actual_spend row for either tool feeds neither side.
   *
   * POST-CUTOVER (mig 0101, A1/A3) CHANGE: the non-Code Claude surfaces used to
   * be excluded here too, for the identical reason — absent from §A, and their
   * §B lane already filters exempt, so an exempt non-Code row reached neither

   * excluded from §B (`v_finance_bill_chargeback` filters it) — the exact same
   * one-directional shape claude-code has always had. They are REMOVED from
   * the exclusion list so this term counts them.
   *
   * NOT double-counted against `nonCodeSurfaces`: that term's §A operand
   * explicitly excludes `chargeback_exempt` rows too (see its own comment), so
   * the exempt carve-out is owned EXCLUSIVELY by this term — `nonCodeSurfaces`
   * only ever measures the non-exempt gap.

   * ── ABSORPTION SWEEP ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   * Four review rounds each found another term that could absorb a phenomenon
   * rather than name one, and each time the residual stayed at zero throughout,
   * because moving money between two terms cannot change a sum. Finding the
   * fifth by waiting for a fifth round is not a method. Every term is therefore
   * classified here by SHAPE, since the shape is what determines whether
   * absorption is possible at all:
   *
   *   FILTERED SUMS - one aggregate over one source, with no second quantity
   *   subtracted from it, so there is nothing for a second phenomenon to cancel
   *   against. (populationDifference negates its own sum, which is a sign, not a
   *   subtraction.)
   *     licenceLanes, populationDifference.
   *
   *   PER-KEY, ONE-DIRECTIONAL - subtract, but only ever inside a
   *   (teammate, day) group and only in one direction, so two different keys
   *   cannot cancel each other:
   *     floor, unreconciledApiLag, unreconciledApiStale.
   *
   *   ESTATE-WIDE SUBTRACTIONS, PROVEN SAFE BY CONSTRUCTION (mig 0101) -
   *   subtracts two whole-window aggregates, which is normally the exact shape
   *   this sweep exists to forbid — EXCEPT where the source relationship
   *   between the two operands is a single unconditional filter with no JOIN
   *   that could drop one row and duplicate another, which makes a per-key
   *   cancellation (one teammate-day missing, another double) structurally
   *   impossible; only a GLOBAL predicate bug remains, and that is exactly what
   *   `chargebackExemptUsage`'s tool-list mirror-check and each lane's
   *   independent in-section-A-vs-raw diagnostic exist to catch:
   *     nonCodeSurfaces, copilotAgentUsage, chargebackExemptUsage.
   *   `nonCodeSurfaces` and `copilotAgentUsage` were FILTERED SUMS before
   *   migration 0101 gave their lanes a real §A arm to subtract (see each
   *   term's own comment for why the pre-0101 form was a pure sum, not a
   *   subtraction, and why post-0101 it safely can be).
   *
   *   STRUCTURALLY ZERO, with the real quantity exposed as a diagnostic:
   *     quarantine (diagnostics.quarantinedOtelUsd) and homingLoss
   *     (diagnostics.unhomedChargeUsd). homingLoss is a literal zero rather than
   *     a computed per-key difference; it is kept in the term list so a reader
   *     sees that homing was considered.
   *
   *   THE REMAINDER - and there is exactly one, deliberately:
   *     copilotUsageGap.
   *
   * copilotUsageGap subtracts two estate-wide aggregates AND cannot be proven
   * safe the way the three above were: the §B side is a pooled enterprise
   * invoice with no teammate grain to join on, so there is no predicate fix
   * that could make it keyable. A decomposition needs somewhere for the
   * unnamed to land, and it is better to have one term that admits to being
   * that place than several that do not.
   *
   * What is required of it in exchange is honesty at the surface: its hint names
   * the largest thing known to hide in it (Copilot users with no teammate
   * mapping, skipped before any usage row is written, so billed in §B and absent
   * from §A) and points at the admin surface that can quantify it. Anything else
   * unexplained lands here too. Treat a large or moving copilotUsageGap as
   * unexplained spend, not as a measurement artefact.
   *
   * THE PREDICTED SCENARIO, RESOLVED (mig 0101). This section used to warn: "if
   * coding-agent spend ever becomes visible to §A, copilotAgentUsage keeps
   * counting it AND copilotUsageGap falls by the same amount... the residual
   * will not report that double-count... codingAgentInSectionAUsd is surfaced
   * as an independent alarm instead". That day has now arrived — arm 3 makes
   * the lane §A-visible — and the resolution is exactly as designed:
   * `copilotAgentUsage` became the true (raw − §A) term (reading ~0 when
   * healthy, not silently absorbing anything), `copilotUsageGap`'s CODE did not
   * change and reads the SAME value it always did (see its residual-preserving
   * algebra note), and `codingAgentInSectionAUsd` / `codingAgentRawUsd` remain
   * the independent, non-summed pair that would catch an absence or a
   * double-count even if some OTHER term's cancellation masked it from the
   * residual. The same three-part answer (true term + unchanged neighbour +
   * independent diagnostic pair) is why `nonCodeSurfaces` could follow the
   * identical shape for its own lane.
