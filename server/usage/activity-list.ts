/*
 * Activity list — the ONE union read behind `GET /me/activity` and its CSV
 * (design: docs/design/developer-pages-consolidation/04-fix-sprint-design.md
 * §F4, D17-D20). The contract, and why the list holds both row kinds, is
 * documented on `shared/schemas/activity.ts`; this module is the mechanism.
 *
 * ONE SORT KEY, AND IT IS THE UTC DAY (D18). The two kinds have different
 * natural grains — a conversation is an instant, a provider-recorded day is a
 * bucket — so the only key they can BOTH honestly answer is the UTC day. Within
 * a day the order is completed by a rank (sessions before the day-level record)
 * and, for sessions only, their last event; the day-level rows sort among
 * themselves on their id. Every leg is a real, stored value: nothing is
 * synthesised to make the sort work, which is the whole point.
 *
 * KEYSET, NOT OFFSET. The sort tuple is `(day, rank, ts, id)`, ALL DESCENDING —
 * deliberately uniform, so the resumption predicate is one Postgres row-value
 * comparison (`(...) < (...)`) rather than four hand-rolled OR-chains that drift.
 * The tuple is total: `id` is unique within a kind and `rank` separates the
 * kinds, so no two rows tie and no row can be skipped or repeated across pages.
 *
 * BOTH SIDES BOUNDED — A WORK BOUND, NOT A FAIRNESS ONE. Each branch applies the
 * SAME keyset predicate and its own `LIMIT n+1` before the union; the union then
 * re-sorts and takes n+1. Taking the global top-n from the per-branch top-n is
 * EXACT — it is the same page an unbounded union would produce, which is the
 * whole point: the bound changes what is READ, never what is RETURNED.
 *
 * So it is not a fairness device and this module does not claim one. A teammate
 * whose newest n records are all sessions gets a first page of all sessions, and
 * their provider-recorded days appear further down the SAME descending-day
 * order, exactly where the day they belong to falls. That is the ordering
 * contract, not starvation: nothing is dropped, and a walk of the pages reaches
 * every row of both kinds. A guarantee that each page held some of each kind
 * would be a different (and dishonest) list — it would have to reorder records
 * away from the one sort key they can both answer.
