/*
 * ── THE ONE OPERAND ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * "Corroborated, provider-billed OTel, per (teammate, UTC day[, tool])."
 *
 * Design: docs/design/emitting-identity-and-subscription-type.md §7, §9.
 *
 * WHY IT IS A MODULE. Three separate queries net §A against this same quantity,
 * and they must agree with each other exactly:
 *
 *   - server/usage/unaccounted-reconciliation.ts — the UNDER direction
 *     (API − OTel → the taggable "needs tagging" residual)
 *   - server/usage/over-emission-detection.ts    — the OVER direction
 *     (OTel − API → the suspected-forgery flag)
 *   - server/usage/ab-decomposition.ts           — the floor and unreconciled
 *     terms, which MODEL the two queries above
 *
 * Each of the three previously carried its own copy. Change two and leave the
 * third and nothing fails: the decomposition's residual still closes (moving
 * money between terms cannot change a sum), so the breakage is silent. That is
 * why this is one exported fragment rather than a convention.
 *
 * ── WHAT IT EXCLUDES, AND WHY EACH EXCLUSION IS HERE ────────────────────────
 *
 * 1. OPEN `api-uncorroborated` QUARANTINES. Conversations the developer has
 *    confirmed as forgeries. Pre-existing behaviour: the under and over lanes
 *    must net against the SAME corroborated OTel, or a quarantined forgery
 *    inflates the OTel total and MASKS genuine un-enrolled usage that day.
 *
 * 2. `billing_lane = 'self-billed'` (mig 0119). Spend emitted from a personal
 *    subscription has no invoice behind it, so it must not be subtracted from
 *    the provider's bill. Leaving it in is what suppresses a mixed teammate's
 *    needs-tagging worklist by exactly the amount of their personal usage.
 *
 * ── DAY BINNING ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `(ts_event AT TIME ZONE 'UTC')::date`, never a bare `::date` — the latter
 * casts in the session TimeZone and disagrees at every day boundary on a server
 * not set to UTC.
 *
 * ── PER-CELL COMPLETENESS (§9) — the part that is easy to get wrong ─────────
 *
 * The new exclusion is applied PER CELL, not globally. A `(teammate, day, tool)`
 * cell containing ANY `unknown` row keeps the OLD operand (sum everything); only
 * a fully-stamped cell uses the new one.
 *
 * This is not caution, it is correctness. Rows written before mig 0119 sit at
 * 'unknown'. If a cell mixes stamped and unstamped rows and we applied the new
 * operand, the still-'unknown' self-billed rows would remain in the subtrahend
 * and PARTIALLY suppress the residual — a figure that is neither the old
 * behaviour nor the new one, and that nothing would flag. Holding a partial cell
 * on the old operand keeps it exactly reproducing today, which is why 'unknown'
 * is a distinct lane value rather than folded into 'provider-billed'.
 *
 * COMPLETENESS IS EVALUATED OVER THE POST-QUARANTINE POPULATION. The quarantine
 * exclusion is in the WHERE clause, so `bool_or` sees only rows that survive it.
 * Moving that exclusion into a FILTER would let ONE quarantined 'unknown' row —
 * a row that contributes nothing to either total — force otherwise-valid
 * self-billed rows back into the subtrahend.
 *
 * COST AND TOKENS USE THE IDENTICAL TEST. `unaccounted_usage` recomputes both;
 * excluding self-billed cost but not its tokens yields one row whose dollars and
 * tokens describe different populations.
